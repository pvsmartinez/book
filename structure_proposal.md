# Book Project Structure Proposals

Based on your goal to write a "knowledge book" starting from "scattered ideas" and "connecting the dots", here are three proposed folder structures.

## Option 1: The "Gardener" (Zettelkasten-inspired)
**Best for:** Connecting dots, organic growth, discovering the structure as you go.
This structure focuses on capturing ideas first (`Seeds`), linking them together to find patterns, and then letting the book structure emerge from those connections.

*   **`00_Inbox`**: The dumping ground. Quick notes, voice transcripts, raw thoughts. No structure required here.
*   **`01_Seeds`**: Refined, atomic ideas. Each file is one concept (e.g., `perception_of_time.md`). This is where you "connect the dots" by linking files together.
*   **`02_Structure`**: Outlines, mind maps, and high-level plans that emerge from your seeds.
*   **`03_Manuscript`**: The actual chapters of the book, written by assembling your seeds.
*   **`04_Resources`**: External knowledge (articles, quotes, references) that support your ideas.
*   **`99_Compost`**: Ideas that didn't make the cut but might be useful later.

## Option 2: The "Architect" (PARA Method)
**Best for:** Clear separation of duties, project management, finishing the book efficiently.
Based on the "Building a Second Brain" methodology. It separates the *Project* (the book) from the *Resources* (the ideas).

*   **`1_Projects`**:
    *   `The_Book`: Contains `Drafts`, `Chapters`, `Edits`.
*   **`2_Areas`**: Ongoing responsibilities related to the book (e.g., `Marketing`, `Publishing_Research`).
*   **`3_Resources`**:
    *   `Topic_A`: Notes on specific topics.
    *   `Topic_B`: Notes on other topics.
    *   `Inspirations`: Books, articles, etc.
*   **`4_Archives`**: Completed chapters, old research.

## Option 3: The "Flow" (Linear Process)
**Best for:** Moving strictly from chaos to order in stages.
A simple pipeline structure. You move files from one folder to the next as they mature.

*   **`01_Brainstorming`**: All your scattered ideas go here.
*   **`02_Sorting`**: Ideas that are being grouped into themes.
*   **`03_Outlining`**: The ordered plan of the book.
*   **`04_Drafting`**: Writing the actual content.
*   **`05_Polishing`**: Final edits.

## Recommendation
Given you mentioned "connecting the dots" and "scattered knowledge", **Option 1 (The Gardener)** is likely the strongest fit. It explicitly creates a space (`Seeds`) for individual ideas to live and connect before they are forced into a chapter structure.
