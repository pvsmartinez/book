### 1. Habits as Iterations
*   **The Concept:** You are a system. Your habits are your iterations.
*   **The Fix:** Don't rely on Willpower (Variance). Rely on Environment (Selection).
*   **Example:** If you want to lose weight, don't "try harder." Remove the junk food from the house (Change the Environment).

### 2. Career as Value Function
*   **The Concept:** Your job has a Value Function.
*   **The Fix:** Are you optimizing for Money, Status, or Mastery? Be honest. If you optimize for Money, don't be surprised if you lack Mastery.

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "If we can fix ourselves, can we fix the world?"
*   **Lead-in:** Chapter 17 (The Macro-Lens).
