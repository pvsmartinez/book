<summary><strong>Chapter Outline & Blocking</strong></summary>

**Status:** Blocking
**Goal:** Explain the "Engine" of the framework (Iteration & Variance).

### 1. The Hook: The Infinite Monkey Theorem
*   **The Analogy:** If you give a million monkeys typewriters, eventually one writes Shakespeare.
*   **The Reality:** That takes too long. Nature doesn't have infinite time.
*   **The Better Way:** What if every time a monkey got a letter right, you kept it?
*   **The Concept:** This is **Selection**. It turns "Random Chance" into "Inevitable Success."

### 2. The Formula: How Systems Learn
*   **The Equation:** $$ \text{Adaptation} = \text{Iteration} \times \text{Variance} $$
*   **Variable 1: Iteration (Volume)**
    *   You need *tries*.
    *   Example: A startup needs to launch features. A species needs generations.
    *   Rule: **Quantity begets Quality.**
*   **Variable 2: Variance (The Mutation)**
    *   You need *difference*.
    *   If every try is the same, you learn nothing.
    *   Example: Genetic mutation, A/B testing in software.
    *   Rule: **You need to be wrong to find what's right.**

### 3. The Insight: Intelligence is Just Speed
*   **The "Black Box":** We think of "Genius" as a magical spark. But usually, it is just someone who iterated faster than everyone else.
*   **The Accelerator:**
    *   **Nature:** Iterates slowly (20 years per human generation).
    *   **Technology:** Iterates instantly (Millions of AI training runs per second).
    *   **The Consequence:** We have moved the "Engine" from biology to silicon. The feedback loops are tightening.

### 4. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "We know the formula. But what happens when you crank the 'Iteration' dial to the max? You get a monster."
*   **Lead-in:** Chapter 3 (The Giraffe & The Tree).
