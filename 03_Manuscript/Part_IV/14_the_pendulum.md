## Chapter 14: The Pendulum

<details>
<summary><strong>Chapter Outline & Blocking</strong></summary>

**Status:** Blocking
**Goal:** Synthesis of Part IV. Static vs. Dynamic Systems.

---

### 1. The Synthesis: Efficiency vs. Resilience
*   **The Trade-off:** You cannot have both.
*   **The Trap:** We always choose Efficiency (because it pays off *now*) and sacrifice Resilience (because the cost is *later*).

### 2. The Solution: Oscillation
*   **The Concept:** Healthy systems breathe. They swing back and forth.
    *   Politics: Left $\leftrightarrow$ Right.
    *   Economy: Boom $\leftrightarrow$ Bust.
*   **The Danger:** When we try to *stop* the pendulum (bailouts, suppressing dissent), we stop the correction. The pressure builds until it snaps.

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "We understand the machine. We understand the trap. Now... how do we fix it?"
*   **Lead-in:** Part V (The Designer).
