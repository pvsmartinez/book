### 1. The Concept: Small Advantages
*   **The Math:** 1.01^365 = 37.7.
*   **The Reality:** In a selection system, a tiny advantage in the beginning (being slightly taller, slightly richer, slightly earlier) compounds into total dominance.
*   **Key Seeds:** [[time_and_compounding]], [[capitalism_optimization]].

### 2. The Winner Take All
*   **The Outcome:** Systems naturally trend toward inequality.
*   **The Mechanism:** The winner gets more resources $\rightarrow$ iterates faster $\rightarrow$ wins more.
*   **The Lesson:** Inequality is not an anomaly; it is the default state of an unchecked selection system.

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "We see this in nature. But where do we see it most violently in our lives?"
*   **Lead-in:** Chapter 12 (The Whale Economy).
