### 1. The Mobile Game Model
*   **The Data:** 98% of players pay nothing. 2% of players (Whales) pay everything.
*   **The Design:** The game is optimized for the Whales. The "Free" players are just content for the Whales to consume/beat.
*   **Key Seeds:** [[the_whale_economy_and_game_design]].

### 2. The Real Economy
*   **The Parallel:** Wealth concentration follows the same power law.
*   **The Mechanism:** Capital compounds. Labor does not.
*   **The Result:** The economy begins to optimize for the "Whales" (Luxury condos, high-end services) while the "Free Players" (Workers) are squeezed.

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "The system is efficient. But it is fragile. What happens when the Whales eat all the food?"
*   **Lead-in:** Chapter 13 (The Cheetah's Dilemma).
