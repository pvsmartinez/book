---

### 1. The Story: The Cheetah
*   **The Optimization:** The Cheetah is the perfect running machine.
*   **The Cost:** It has no fat reserves. It has weak jaws. If it misses a hunt, it dies. If it gets injured, it dies.
*   **The Concept:** It is **Over-Optimized**. It traded *Resilience* for *Performance*.

### 2. The Just-in-Time World
*   **The Parallel:** Supply chains (Toyota Model).
*   **The Optimization:** Zero inventory. Maximum efficiency.
*   **The Crash:** One boat gets stuck in the Suez Canal (or a pandemic hits), and the whole world stops.
*   **Key Seeds:** [[shifting_value_functions]].

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "We have built a Ferrari world with no brakes. How do we stop it from crashing?"
*   **Lead-in:** Chapter 14 (The Pendulum).
