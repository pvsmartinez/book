<summary><strong>Chapter Outline & Blocking</strong></summary>

**Status:** Blocking
**Goal:** Deep Dive Example of a specific Value Function (Test Scores).

### 1. The Story: The Student
*   **The Scenario:** A student who loves learning vs. a student who memorizes for the test.
*   **The Outcome:** The memorizer gets the 'A'. The learner gets the 'B'.
*   **The Selection:** The system selects the memorizer for the best colleges.

### 2. The Distortion
*   **The Metric:** "Test Score" was supposed to measure "Intelligence."
*   **The Reality:** It measures "Test Taking Ability."
*   **The Consequence:** We build an education system that optimizes for a proxy, not the actual goal.
*   **Key Seeds:** [[education_and_the_exam_trap]].

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "If a simple test can distort a human mind, what can a complex algorithm do to a culture?"
*   **Lead-in:** Chapter 9 (The Algorithm's Eye).
