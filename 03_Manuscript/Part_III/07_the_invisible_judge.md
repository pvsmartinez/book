## Chapter 7: The Invisible Judge

<details>
<summary><strong>Chapter Outline & Blocking</strong></summary>

**Status:** Blocking
**Goal:** Explain the "Environment" as a "Value Function" (The Filter).

---

### 1. The Concept: The Value Function
*   **The Definition:** The environment isn't just "nature." It is a **Rule** that decides who wins.
*   **The Mechanism:** It acts as a filter. It doesn't care about "good" or "bad." It only cares about "fitting the rule."
*   **Key Seeds:** [[natural_selection]], [[machine_learning_selection]].

### 2. The Invisible Hand is a Judge
*   **The Metaphor:** We think of the "Invisible Hand" as a benevolent force. It is actually a ruthless judge.
*   **The Verdict:** If the rule is "Profit," the judge kills anything that doesn't make money. If the rule is "Survival," the judge kills anything that is slow.

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "We know the judge exists. Now let's see what happens when the judge has a very specific, very narrow rule."
*   **Lead-in:** Chapter 8 (The Exam Trap).
