## Chapter 10: You Are What You Measure

<details>
<summary><strong>Chapter Outline & Blocking</strong></summary>

**Status:** Blocking
**Goal:** Synthesis of Part III. The danger of Proxy Metrics.

---

### 1. The Synthesis: The "Best" is a Lie
*   **The Insight:** There is no "Best" politician, "Best" company, or "Best" art.
*   **The Reality:** There is only "The Fittest" for the current metric.
*   **The Trap:** We think we are optimizing for "Good," but we are usually optimizing for a "Proxy" (GDP, Grades, Likes, Stock Price).

### 2. Goodhart's Law
*   **The Law:** "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
*   **The Mechanism:** The system learns to hack the metric.
*   **Key Seeds:** [[machine_learning_selection]], [[fake_news_and_anger]].

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "We have the Engine (Part II) and the Filter (Part III). Now, what happens when you leave this machine running for 50 years?"
*   **Lead-in:** Part IV (The Compounder).
