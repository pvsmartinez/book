## Chapter 11: The Medium

The second variable of the Value Function is **The Track**, and it's the variable we most often ignore. When we fail, we usually check the Rules ("Did I miss a requirement?"), Or we check our own Performance ("Did I work hard enough?"). We rarely look down at the terrain.

But the terrain, the **Medium**, is often the real decision-maker. It has friction. It has texture. It even has its own physics. It is the mold into which our behavior is poured.

Think of an ocean wave. Some waves are tall and crash violently against cliffs; others are long and roll gently onto the sand. Does the water "decide" to be violent or gentle? No. The water is just energy. The shape of the wave is decided by the **Seabed**.

We are like that water. We take the shape of the container we are poured into.

The track will determine how effective our actions are. And because of that, it shapes behavior and adaptation.

### The Shape of Stories

Let's imagine the Television. If you grew up in the 90s, you probably watched shows like *Friends*, *Law & Order*, or *The Simpsons*. If you analyze the structure of these shows, they all share a distinct shape. We call it "The Status Quo Loop."

Ross and Rachel might fight on Thursday, or a murder might happen, but by the end of the 22-minute episode, the problem is solved, and the world resets to normal. Next Thursday, you can tune in without knowing anything about the previous week.

Why did they write like this? Was it because 90s writers lacked ambition? Was it because audiences were stupid?
No. It was because of the **Medium**.

Broadcast TV was linear. The network had no guarantee that you watched last week's episode. They knew that if they wrote a complex, serialized story where you needed to see Chapter 4 to understand Chapter 5, you would change the channel. They would lose the viewer.
The **Track** (Linear Broadcast) physically punished complexity. It was selected for "Episodic" content: stories that could be consumed in any order, with zero context.

Then came streaming.
When Netflix launched House of Cards, they changed the Geometry. Suddenly, the entire season was available at once. The platform knew you watched the previous episode. In fact, it auto-played the next one.
The risk of "losing the viewer" vanished.

Suddenly, *Breaking Bad* and *Game of Thrones* became possible. Writers could create massive, 50-hour movie arcs where a tiny detail in Hour 1 pays off in Hour 40.

The writers didn't just "get smarter." The **Track** changed from a "Hop-on Hop-off Bus" to a "High-Speed Train." The nature of the art changed because the delivery physics changed.

As a constant reminder, we should remember that the writers tried all types of shows in both eras. This was the **Variance**. As each show was created, some were more successful than others. Then, a new batch of shows gets funding through their pitches and is developed and streamed/broadcast. Some shows succeed, while others fail. It's natural that, from these actions and feedback, each batch is an **Iteration**; the future shows pick what worked from past shows and add a small tweak to make it unique (Adds **Variance** once more). This shapes the shows that are created over time.

Each success or failure of a show affects the next one that will be developed. This makes the show creation in the pattern. The rules themselves usually are the same (Who's the most popular, brought more money, usually from reach). What changed the type of show then was the medium. A strategy for a show that is seen with skipped chapters is different from a show that you can binge-watch.

Today, this might seem obvious and is taught in arts schools, as viewers know what to expect from a film, a series, a TV soap opera, and so on. But this knowledge, just as in the Salesman example from Chapter 2, was built through these iterations and experiments. It came from the empirical studies of the pattern in real time.

During the rest of the book, we might skip several steps of the pattern at times, explaining how a filter shapes the outcome. To make reading flow, we won't enter the details of the pattern every time, but it is essential to remind ourselves that it is the force of **Iteration** x **Variance** over **Time** that enables such selection to adapt something into a mold, a behavior, a shape.

During any sudden change in the medium, the rules, or the competitors, we will see a period of experimentation. Players and competitors are trying new things, different things, what works and what doesn't, until they reach a point of maturity. Cellphone companies might innovate a lot on their first-generation products. The first phones using touch screen could be really different from each other. But at some point, every new iteration and phone became similar to the next.

When streaming came along, the first shows were similar to those on TV. They didn't fully utilize the benefits of the new medium. Just like a video game did not use all the features of a console. There is always a learning curve in how best to use these new products and this new medium. And as we explained before, learning occurs through the pattern of iteration.

### The News Cycle: A Change of Geometry

This can be seen even with serious topics, such as The Truth and the news.

We often ask: "Why has the news become so angry? Why is it so polarized?"
We assume the "Players" (Journalists) have lost their integrity. We blame their morals. But if we look at the Geometry of their Track, the answer is simpler. They are just trying to survive on a new map.

**1. The Newspaper (The Subscription Track)**
The physical newspaper in the 90s had some physical constraints:
*   **Space:** You only have a certain number of pages.
*   **Time:** You publish once every 24 hours.
*   **Payment:** You pay Upfront (Subscription).

This Track selects for **Trust**. If the paper lies to you on Tuesday, you cancel on Wednesday. Since they already have your money, they don't need to scream at you every 5 minutes. They can afford to be boring. They can afford to say "We don't know yet."

Of course, they were not perfect. A newspaper would try to omit a different political view to avoid alienating its readers, just as a magazine or a channel does today.

**2. Cable News (The Loop Track)**
Then came Cable (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, GloboNews). The constraints flipped.
*   **Space:** Infinite (24 hours to fill).
*   **Payment:** Ads (Attention).

They need you to *not change the channel*.
"Trust" is a slow burn. But "Fear" is immediate. If I tell you "Everything is fine," you change the channel to watch a sitcom. If I tell you, "There is a threat to your children," you stay.
The Track changed from a "Morning Briefing" to a "24-Hour Anxiety Loop." The organisms adapted. The "boring" journalist went extinct; the "alarmist" pundit thrived.

**3. Social Media (The Scroll Track)**
Now we have the Feed. The constraints are even tighter.
*   **Space:** The size of a phone screen.
*   **Speed:** A thumb-flick (milliseconds).
*   **Payment:** Number of views (Times ads shown).

In this environment, "Nuance" is physically impossible. You cannot explain a complex tax policy in a space that is scrolled past in 0.5 seconds.
The only thing that stops the thumb is **High Arousal Emotion**. Anger, shock, outrage, or "The Dunk."

Truth is often boring. Truth is often "It's complicated."
But "It's complicated" has a viral coefficient of zero.
"They are stealing your country" spreads like a virus. It has a high **contagion rate**.

As we explained during Part 2 of this book, news can work as memetics. They viralize, they "survive" through the strongest emotions, and the medium has shaped them.
The shape of the medium can be clear like these examples (Where the technology changed), but it can also be something internal in the software itself.

### The Evolution of YouTube

Look at the history of YouTube. The **Rule Set** (The Algorithm) changed explicitly, and we saw the species (The Creators) mutate in response.

Let's walk through the eras.

**Phase 1: The Click (2005-2012)**
In the early days, YouTube's Value Function was simple: **Views**.
The system rewarded whatever got clicked. If you clicked, the creator got a point.

Think about what survives in this environment. If you spend three months making a thoughtful documentary, you get one thumbnail. If you spend ten minutes filming your cat jumping into a box, you also get one thumbnail.
Since the reward is equal, the winning strategy is **Volume**.
The "Click Era" was dominated by the "Reply Girl," misleading thumbnails with red arrows, and 10-second clips of people getting hit in the crotch.
It wasn't that the creators were stupid. It was that "smart" content physically could not survive. Intelligence requires time, and the medium didn't sell time. It sold clicks.

**Phase 2: The Time (2012-2016)**
Then, the engineers at Google realized a problem. They were selling ads, but nobody was watching them. You can't put a 30-second commercial on a 10-second cat video. To build a real business, they needed you to stay.
So they tweaked the code. They stopped optimizing for **Clicks** and started optimizing for **Watch Time**.
This sounds like a small technical change. But it caused a mass extinction event.

The "10-second cat video" died instantly. Why? Because you need to watch 180 cat videos to equal the Watch Time of a single 30-minute video. The short video simply couldn't compete.

But what replaced it? The documentary?
No. The documentary still takes three months to make. It's too slow.
The species that exploded was **Gaming**. Specifically, the "Let's Play."

Think about the economics of a "Let's Play" video. Creating a 30-minute animation takes six months and costs thousands of dollars. Creating a 30-minute video of yourself playing *Minecraft* takes... 30 minutes and costs zero dollars.
Gaming was the *only* content species that could produce high-duration content daily without bankrupting the creator.

The algorithm didn't "love" Minecraft. It didn't care about blocks or zombies. It just wanted cheap, infinite minutes. And *Minecraft* was the most efficient fuel for that engine.
PewDiePie didn't become the biggest star in the world by accident. He was the perfect organism for the "Watch Time" era.

The creators didn't wake up one day and decide to become gamers. The **Track** was selected for them.

YouTube has changed its algorithm a few times already, and with it, each time the biggest channels changed.

In a sense, today's news is more like the early days of YouTube with the nonsense videos and misleading clickbait, than with how they were born with newspapers.

The Algorithm of social media is not necessarily evil, It is just counting clicks (or watch time). But because the **Track** requires immediate, high-speed engagement, the System selects for polarization. It selects for the content that infects the most hosts in the shortest time.

The Algorithm has a tremendous force due to the pattern. These social media platforms have so many creators and views that they exhibit significant variance and a high rate of iteration. You could argue that the volume of iteration and adaptation on those platforms is as strong or as fast as a virus. Millions of creations per day, with brutal, rapid validations; small tweaks to the value function quickly optimize user behavior and content.

We are seeing this right now with AI on social media, the so called AI Slop, with so many tests and iterations, the very nature of how those videos are presented are changing over time. Probably until this book is released, the videos will be so different from those being created today (January 2026) that I won't even go into detail. But more than just the technology evolving, the creators that use "AI Slop" are so huge in volume, and are experimenting so quickly, that I would bet unless some law/rule comes up, the videos from AI will blend from the videos without, and we will find some form of accepted AI generated content, just because the pattern is selecting as we speak the content that is accepted or not, at a extreme pacing.

The medium and its rules shape what works and what does not. It defines what's effective, and they create a force like a river. If a player tries to swim against it, they should expect conflict. It’s not impossible, but there are actions that get rewarded by the pattern, and actions that are not.

If you see a trend shaping up, having more and more variety and volume, but even still growing into a medium, try asking yourself how the medium is shaping this result.

The Pattern doesn't care about what you want to be. It only cares about what the track allows you to be.
