# Part III: Restricted Proposal (The Humane Version)

## The Philosophy
We are keeping the **Stories** (Soul) but sharpening the **Lesson** (Structure).
Each chapter will feel like a standalone narrative, but underneath, it is secretly teaching one variable of the Value Function equation (`VF = Rules + Track + Competitors`).

## The New Chapter Map

| Chapter | Title (The Story) | The Hidden Lesson (The Variable) | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **09** | **The Invisible Judge** | **The Equation (Intro)** | *Re-written.* Sets the stage: "Value isn't magic; it's a calculation." |
| **10** | **The Algorithm's Brain** | **The Rule Set (Explicit)** | AI is the perfect teacher for **Rules**. It shows that if you write a rule (Code), the system will follow it perfectly, even if it ignores "Common Sense." |
| **11** | **The Invisible Hand** | **The Competitors (Relative)** | The Market (Bakers) teaches **Relativity**. Your bread is only "good" if it's better than the neighbor's. Explains the "Red Queen Effect." |
| **12** | **The Medium** | **The Track (Implicit)** | Social Media teaches **The Track**. The "Wave and Coastline" analogy perfectly explains how the *environment* shapes the message, regardless of intent. |
| **13** | **The Exam Trap** | **The Proxy (Measurement)** | Schools teach **The Proxy**. We want "Intelligence" (Goal) but we measure "Grades" (Proxy). This shows where the equation usually breaks. |
| **14** | **The Cobra Effect** | **Synthesis (Outcomes)** | The Cobra story teaches **Consequences**. Shows what happens when you combine all these variables: The system optimizes for the "Wrong Thing" (Dead Snakes). |

## Proposed Actions
1.  **Refactor Ch 10 (Algorithm):** Focus on the "Dumb Computer" following instructions too literally.
2.  **Refactor Ch 11 (Hand):** Focus on "Relative Fitness" – why value is a moving target.
3.  **Swap Ch 12 & 13:** Move **The Medium** earlier. It fits better as a fundamental constraint (The Track) before we talk about **The Exam** (The Proxy), which is a specific human error.
4.  **Rename Ch 14:** Change "You Are What You Measure" to **"The Cobra Effect"** to match the story-driven titles of the rest of the book.

This structure preserves all your user-style examples (The Baker, The Wave, The Student, The Cobra) but gives Part III the same rigorous "Introduction -> Variations -> Synthesis" flow that Parts II and IV have.
