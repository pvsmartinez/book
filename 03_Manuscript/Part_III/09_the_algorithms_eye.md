## Chapter 9: The Algorithm's Eye

<details>
<summary><strong>Chapter Outline & Blocking</strong></summary>

**Status:** Blocking
**Goal:** Deep Dive Example of Algorithmic Selection (YouTube).

---

### 1. The History of YouTube
*   **Era 1: Clicks (2006-2012):** The goal was "Views." Result: Clickbait, misleading thumbnails, 30-second clips.
*   **Era 2: Watch Time (2012-Present):** The goal changed to "Time Spent." Result: Let's Plays, Video Essays, Conspiracy Theories (Rabbit Holes).
*   **Key Seeds:** [[youtube_algorithm_history]].

### 2. The Content Shift
*   **The Observation:** The creators didn't change. The *code* changed.
*   **The Adaptation:** Creators who adapted to the new metric survived. Those who didn't died.
*   **The Lesson:** The culture we consume is a direct output of the metric the algorithm optimizes for.

### 3. The Bridge
*   **Closing Thought:** "We are watching the output of a machine. But what happens to the machine when it runs for too long?"
*   **Lead-in:** Chapter 10 (You Are What You Measure).
