## Chapter 13: The Competitors

If you can run a six-minute mile, are you fast?

In a high school gym class, you are a god. At the Olympic trials, you don't make the cut. Your speed didn't change. The room did.

That's the third force in the Value Function: **The Competitors**.

### The Living Terrain

The Track is usually static. A mountain does not grow taller just because you are a good climber. The rules of gravity don't change because you invented a better airplane.

Competitors are different. They are **Adaptive**.

They are iterating at the same time you are. They are watching your successes and copying them. They are feeling the same feedback loops and adjusting their strategies. In a system driven by The Pattern, the "best" thing to do depends entirely on what everyone else is doing.

There's a thought experiment from biology that captures this perfectly: **Hawks and Doves**.

Imagine a population fighting over food, a piece of meat on the ground. In this world, there are two strategies (not two species, just two ways to play the game):

1.  **The Hawk**: Aggressive and relentless. A Hawk will fight until it is either seriously injured or its opponent is dead. It never backs down.
2.  **The Dove**: Not "peaceful" in a moral sense, but a master of posturing. A Dove will puff its feathers, hiss, and try to intimidate. But the second the opponent actually attacks, the Dove retreats. It values its skin more than the meat.

Now, watch how the **Competitors** (the population) dictate the value of these actions:

*   **Hawk vs. Hawk**: They fight until one is horribly injured. The cost of the injury is usually higher than the value of the meat. On average, a two-Hawk fight is a losing game for both. 
*   **Hawk vs. Dove**: The Hawk gets the meat for free. The Dove runs away with zero meat and no injuries.
*   **Dove vs. Dove**: They spend a long time posturing and showing off, wasting some energy, but eventually, one gives up, or they split the prize. No one gets hurt.

If you live in a world of **Pure Doves**, being a Dove is great. Everyone is polite, and you share the meat. But this world is an "Evolutionary Vacuum." If a single **Hawk** mutant appears, it becomes a god. It wins every single fight without ever getting injured (because Doves always run). The Hawk eats better, reproduces faster, and soon the population is flooded with Hawks.

But a world of **Pure Hawks** is a nightmare. Everyone is constantly bleeding. The "cost of injury" is so high that the average bird is worse off than if it had no meat at all. In this bloody world, if a **Dove** mutant appears, it suddenly has the "winning" strategy. Why? Because the Dove loses every fight, but it *never gets injured*. Zero is a better score than negative. As Hawks are expected to die fighting, a player who won't die in interactions will eventually find a prize with no contestants.

The Dove thrives in a world of Hawks. The Hawk thrives in a world of Doves.

The Value Function isn't tied to the meat; it's tied to the **Population**. The "best" strategy is invisible until you know who else is on the field. The system naturally oscillates until it reaches a balance, an equilibrium where the number of Hawks and Doves makes them both equally "fit."
Why does this matter to you?

Because the "Competitors" aren't just in other people's stories. You are a competitor in every system you participate in. And the forces we just saw in this thought experiment play out in markets, careers, and industries every day.
If this example was too hypothetical for you, let’s look at our pockets. Let’s look at the story of **Gaming**.

### The Pay-Per-Life Era

The history of video games is a perfect laboratory for watching how competitors sculpt a value function.

In the beginning, games lived in **Arcades**. This was the Track. The machines were in public places, bars, and malls. There were more players than machines.

The owners needed "Rotation." They needed you to play, lose, and move so the next person could insert a coin. Or, they needed you to lose so *you* would insert another coin.

This environment is selected for **Difficulty**.
Old arcade games like *Pac-Man* or *Donkey Kong* were brutally hard because they were designed for short sessions. There were no "Save Systems" or deep narratives. The Value Function rewarded games that could kill you in three minutes while making you feel like you *almost* won.

The competitors (the developers) weren't trying to make you "happy" any less than modern developers are. They were trying to survive the arcade market. If your game were too easy, the arcade owner wouldn't buy it because it wouldn't make enough coins per hour. The competition forced a "Hardcore" meta.

If you ever wondered why old games were so absurdly difficult, now you know. It wasn't sadism. It was the Value Function of the arcade.

### The Home Comforts

Then the Track changed. We got **Consoles** and **PCs** inside our homes.

Suddenly, you didn't pay per life; you paid once for the box. Rotation no longer mattered. If you lost too much, you'd get frustrated and not buy the sequel.

The Value Function shifted toward **Engagement** and **Narrative**. Games got easier. They added "Saves." They added long stories.

This transition was slow. Because it took years to develop, manufacture, and ship a physical cartridge, the "feedback" from the market was noisy and delayed. Designers slowly realized that easier, more accessible games reached larger audiences, but the shift took a decade, not a week.

In this era, the "Competitors" were fighting for shelf space at retail stores. The "Meta" was about branding and box art. 

### The Marketing Arms Race

Then came the Internet and the **Mobile Revolution**. And this is where the Pattern went into overdrive.

You might imagine that the biggest change was the technology, that games changed because phones got faster. But if that were true, why does a Nintendo Switch (which is technically weaker than a modern iPhone) have such different games? 

The answer isn't the device's power, but the **Collective Behavior** of the competitors.

At first, the early digital world was a wild frontier. If you posted a game on Facebook in 2009, the platform allowed you to send messages to all your friends or post on their walls for "free." You could reach millions of people with zero marketing budget. In this low-friction environment, simple, artistic experiments could survive because they didn't need to pay for eyes.

But as the Internet grew more crowded, the "free" space (the organic, viral reach) began to die.

This is when the game changed.

Imagine two games of similar quality. One costs \$3. The other is free. To a user scrolling through an app store, the free game has zero friction to entry. The \$3 barrier feels like a wall; a "Free" button feels like an open door. Naturally, the free games reached a much larger audience. "Paid" games on mobile began to die because they couldn't compete with the lure of \$0.

But developers still have to pay rent.

A free game that produces no revenue cannot survive. So, they started testing **In-App Purchases** (IAP). They weren't predatory at first. Just small upgrades or levels to keep the lights on and the servers running.

However, once you have IAP, you have a new variable: **Revenue Per User**. And this is where the competitive loop turns into a trap.

If your free game starts making \$1 per player, you suddenly have a weapon. You can afford to spend money on **Marketing**. You start bidding for ads on Facebook or Google to find new users.

Now look at the competition. If my game makes \$5 per player and yours only makes \$1, I can afford to pay \$2 to acquire a new user. You can't. If you spend \$1.01, you lose money. If I spend \$2, I still have \$3 in profit.

I will outbid you for every eyeball on the internet. Your game ends up in the app store graveyard.

See the escalation? 

As globalization hit and the market became saturated with millions of developers, the bidding war reached a fever pitch. Marketing, not art or production, became the most expensive part of making a game. To stay visible, you *had* to earn more from each user than you spent to acquire them.

This pressure forced the evolution of monetization into more extreme forms:
1.  Simple IAPs became **Gachas** and **Skinner Boxes**, using psychological triggers and randomness to maximize the average spend per player.
2.  Developers stopped looking for the average player and started hunting for **Whales**, the 1% who will spend millions. In this high-stakes auction for visibility, the Whale became the only customer that mattered. The 99% of free players became just "content" to keep the server populated for the whales.
3.  To survive the high bids, developers resorted to survival tactics like **Fake Ads**: ads that show gameplay that doesn't exist, to lower the cost of a user click.

The industry didn't choose to be predatory. It was optimized into a corner. The **Pattern** of competition raised the "cost of visibility" so high that only the most aggressive monetizers could afford to stay in the game. 

Today, the mobile market is so saturated that it's almost impossible for a small, "honest" game to reach the top. The brands are established. The "most fit" organisms are the ones most efficient at converting players into revenue so that they can turn that revenue back into ads.

### The Mirror of the Field

The competitors define "The Meta." They find the loopholes. They push the edges.

On platforms like **Steam**, the Track is different. The audience accepts higher upfront prices and rejects predatory mobile tactics. Because the "Track" and the "Rules" (user reviews and refunds) are distinct, competitors have reached different equilibria. Less predatory. The developers aren't morally superior; the environment doesn't reward that behavior as efficiently.

But in any system where competition is fierce, and feedback is fast (digital marketing, high-frequency trading, professional sports), competitors will eventually optimize out all slack.

They will force the system toward the most extreme version of its Value Function.

The "Invisible Hand" isn't a person. It isn't a conspiracy.

It's the collective behavior of millions of actors, all trying to survive the same Pattern.

We are both the players and the environment. We turn the wheel that grinds us. Understanding this doesn't mean accepting it. But you can't redesign a machine you haven't diagnosed.

So why can't we "stop" playing? Why are we compelled to optimize even when it hurts us?

Because the trap has a structure, it has a **Payoff Matrix**.
