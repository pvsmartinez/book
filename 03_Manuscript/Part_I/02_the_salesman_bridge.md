## Chapter 2: The Salesman

When you picture a "Salesman," you likely see a specific archetype. Maybe a real estate agent or a used car dealer.

Chances are, you’re picturing someone charming. Someone with a firm handshake, a quick smile, and a way with words. Someone who can talk to anyone about anything.

Why?

Is there a secret "University of Sales" that teaches everyone to be the same?

Actually... yes. There are thousands of them. There are seminars, books, courses, and mentors all teaching the same techniques: "Mirror the client's body language," "Ask open-ended questions," "Always be closing."

So, is that the answer? Salespeople are charming because they were *taught* to be charming?

It seems obvious. But ask yourself: **Who wrote the books?**

Who decided that "Charisma" was the curriculum? Why don't the books teach us to be silent, or to look at the floor, or to argue with the customer?

A central committee didn't write the books. The survivors wrote them.

### The Library of Survivors

Imagine the thousands of people who tried to sell something for the first time.

Most of them failed. Some tried to force the sale and got rejected. Some were too timid and never closed. Some tried to be overly logical, boring the customer to death.

But a few stumbled upon something that worked.

Maybe one realized that asking questions made the customer feel valued. Another noticed that smiling, even when they didn't feel like it, disarmed the customer's defenses.

These winners didn't just make a sale; they survived to sell another day. They kept their jobs. They fed their families. And, crucially, they taught their apprentices.

"Don't frown," they’d say. "Smile. Trust me, it works."

This is **Agency** in action. The salesperson is making choices, learning from immediate feedback, and adapting their behavior. Humans are intelligent problem solvers, and we are constantly A/B testing our way through life.

But notice the accumulation.

Over decades, millions of salespeople ran millions of intuitive experiments. The bad strategies (insulting the client, staring at the floor, and over-explaining the product) acted as a filter. The people who used them left the profession. Their "knowledge" died with their careers.

The strategies that worked were kept. They were codified. They were written down in books like *How to Win Friends and Influence People*.

Every new experiment is a new learning experience. A new book written, a new course made. New salespeople then picked up and learned from those, and then tried their own variations, their own takes on the teachings.

The "University of Sales" is not an invention of some genius dean; it is an **archive**. It is a collection of all the successful experiments run by millions of people over hundreds of years.

The reason every salesperson looks the same isn't just because they read the same book. It's because the book is a record of what survived the **Filter**.

### The Filter

The environment (the customer with the money) is the Judge.

If customers loved rude, aggressive arguments, then the "Best Sales Course in the World" would teach you how to scream insults. The "Charming Salesman" would go extinct, and the "Angry Salesman" would be the archetype we all recognize.

We think we are learning skills, but really, we are downloading the patch notes of previous generations. We are standing on a mountain of failed experiments, using only the tools that survived.

Each salesperson just wanted to survive and profit. And as they learned, succeeded, and failed, this knowledge was passed down through generations. Nobody planned it, but this behavior was selected. This behavior was optimized.

This explains why the world feels the way it does.
It explains why every modern movie trailer looks the same.
It explains why every smartphone looks like a rectangular sheet of glass.

(And if you're wondering why these things converge instead of diversifying, we will look at that when we study how optimization compounds over time in Part IV.)

Every process, with agency or without, with consciousness or without, just by selection and accumulation, over time, becomes optimized and fitted to what is being truly evaluated.

**This is the Pattern.**

We will build this notion layer by layer. First, by identifying when this pattern happens and why it’s so strong. It will feel a bit like a simplified version of some systems, but it will be needed for our understanding.

Then we will look at what shapes its own direction and how it evolves over time. This will add a lot of nuance and will feel a bit nihilistic. The pattern is really strong, so things will feel unavoidable. But don’t worry.

The end of the book will add the final layer: system design and how a gardener can tweak the system to change its trajectory. It might be unavoidable that a tree will grow, but how the tree grows can be directed. It might be unavoidable that the pattern optimizes, but it's possible to change its direction.

Once again, these lenses will come step by step, layer by layer.

Shall we begin?
