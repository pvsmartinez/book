## Chapter 2: The Salesman

---

### Draft

When you picture a "Salesman," you likely see a specific archetype. Maybe a real estate agent or a used car dealer.

Chances are, you’re picturing someone charming. Someone with a firm handshake, a quick smile, and a way with words. Someone who can talk to anyone about anything.

Why?

Is there a secret "University of Sales" that teaches everyone to be exactly the same?

Actually... yes. There are thousands of them. There are seminars, books, courses, and mentors all teaching the exact same techniques: "Mirror the client's body language," "Ask open-ended questions," "Always be closing."

So, is that the answer? Salesmen are charming because they were *taught* to be charming?

It seems obvious. But ask yourself: **Who wrote the books?**

Who decided that "Charisma" was the curriculum? Why don't the books teach us to be silent, or to look at the floor, or to argue with the customer?

The books weren't written by a central committee. They were written by the survivors.

### The Library of Survivors

Imagine the thousands of people who tried to sell something for the first time.

Most of them failed. Some tried to force the sale and got rejected. Some were too timid and never closed. Some tried to be overly logical, boring the customer to death.

But a few stumbled upon something that worked.

Maybe one realized that asking questions made the customer feel valued. Another noticed that smiling, even when they didn't feel like it, disarmed the customer's defenses.

These winners didn't just make a sale; they survived to sell another day. They kept their jobs. They fed their families. And, crucially, they taught their apprentices.

"Don't frown," they’d say. "Smile. Trust me, it works."

This is **Agency** in action. The salesperson is making choices, learning from immediate feedback, and adapting their behavior. Humans are intelligent problem solvers, and we are constantly A/B testing our way through life.

But notice the accumulation.

Over decades, millions of salespeople ran millions of intuitive experiments. The bad strategies (insulting the client, staring at the floor, and over-explaining the product) acted as a filter. The people who used them left the profession. Their "knowledge" died with their careers.

The strategies that worked were kept. They were codified. They were written down in books like *How to Win Friends and Influence People*.

Every new experiment is a new learning experience. A new book written, a new course made. New salespeople then picked up and learned from those, and then tried their own variations, their own takes on the teachings.

The "University of Sales" is not an invention of some genius dean; it is an **archive**. It is a collection of all the successful experiments run by millions of people over hundreds of years.

The reason every salesperson looks the same isn't just because they read the same book. It's because the book is a record of what survived the **Filter**.

### The Filter

The environment (the customer with the money) is the Judge.

If customers loved rude, aggressive arguments, then the "Best Sales Course in the World" would teach you how to scream insults. The "Charming Salesman" would go extinct, and the "Angry Salesman" would be the archetype we all recognize.

We think we are learning skills, but really, we are downloading the patch notes of previous generations. We are standing on a mountain of failed experiments, using only the tools that survived.

It is a pattern of selection and accumulation that happens with or without our permission. Over time, every system—whether it’s a profession, a species, or an algorithm—optimizes itself to fit whatever is judging its survival.

This is the Pattern.

We will start by showing that this process occurs everywhere. Then, we will look at how the selection itself works. And finally, we will discuss how to use this knowledge to change the game.
