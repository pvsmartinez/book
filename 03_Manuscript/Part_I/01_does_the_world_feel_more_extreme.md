## Chapter 1: Does the World Feel More Extreme?

I remember when the news was boring.

If you’re old enough, you might remember a scandal about a politician's affair or a debate about tax rates. It felt... manageable. The world had its problems, of course, but they felt like they were happening at a human scale. You could turn off the TV, walk outside, and the noise would stop.

But today, somewhere along the way, the silence disappeared.

It feels like someone turned the volume knob on the world from a 4 to an 11, and then broke the knob off.

I feel it, and I know you feel it, too. It’s a specific kind of exhaustion.

By 2010, the headlines started getting a bit louder. We had the Great Recession, the sudden rise of social media, and a feeling that things were moving faster than we could process.

By 2020, the volume was a deafening roar. A global pandemic, trillion-dollar companies, and political divisions that felt less like "disagreements" and more like "civil wars."

It’s easy to look at this chaos and think the world is breaking. Those things are falling apart. Politics doesn't just feel like a disagreement anymore; it feels like a war, with the soldiers being your neighbors. Wealth doesn't just feel unequal; it feels impossible, with numbers so large they stop making sense. Our attention spans have been shattered into 15-second clips, and we sit there, scrolling, feeling both overstimulated and numb at the same time.

But I am an optimist by nature. I spend my life building systems, designing games, and creating products, and when I look at this chaos, I don't see a broken machine. I see a machine that is working *too well*.

When we feel this pressure, our first instinct is to look for a villain. We want to blame "evil" politicians, "greedy" CEOs, or "unethical" algorithms. We want to believe that if we just removed the "bad people," the system would go back to being "good." We want to ban the players who are ruining the game.

But as you look closer, you start to notice something unsettling. The specific "bad people" change, but the outcomes stay the same. You vote out the politician, but the polarization gets worse. You boycott the company, but the wealth gap grows. You delete the app, but your attention still feels fractured.

It’s as if there is a ghost in the machine, something pushing everything toward the extreme, regardless of who is in charge.

This is where my obsession with systems comes in. When you spend your life balancing games and products, you realize that most "bad behavior" isn't caused by bad people. Incentives cause it.

Look at YouTube. We say the algorithm is "radicalizing" us. But the code has no political agenda. It doesn't have a soul. It has only one goal: **Watch Time**. It is a machine that has been told to learn, by trial and error, what keeps you staring at the screen for one more second. If it learns that a calm, nuanced discussion makes you tune out, but a screaming fight makes you watch, it will show you the fight. Not because it wants to hurt you, but because it is a perfect student of your own psychology.

(The real algorithm is more complex than a single metric, but the principle holds. We'll dissect how these metrics shape behavior in Part III.)

The market is the same. It isn't "trying" to starve anyone; it is simply a massive engine optimizing for efficiency. It is doing exactly what we encoded in its rules: find the most efficient way to allocate capital.

We are living in systems that are self-optimizing toward extremism.

That is a bold claim, and I don't expect you to take it on faith. The mechanism behind it will become clearer as we dive deeper in future chapters.

But the core idea is this: it is neither a conspiracy nor chaos. It is the mathematical inevitability of what happens when any system iterates long enough under a consistent filter.

In this book, I want to hand you this lens. I want to show you the code behind the chaos. Because once you stop hating the players and start understanding the game, you can finally see the path to changing it.
