# Preface: The Lens

I am not an economist. I am not a political scientist. I am not a grandmaster of game theory.

I am a builder. I’ve spent my life designing systems—from software to companies to games—and watching how people interact with them. And when you spend enough time building systems, you start to see the same patterns repeating everywhere.

You see the same mechanics that govern a viral TikTok video shaping a political election. You see the same "survival of the fittest" logic that drives biological evolution driving the collapse of your favorite local coffee shop.

This book is not a textbook. It is not a rigorous academic study. It is a collection of observations—a pair of glasses, if you will.

My goal is simple: I want to show you the invisible machinery that is humming beneath the surface of our daily lives. I want to show you why the world feels like it’s getting more extreme, why everyone seems to be shouting, and why "common sense" feels increasingly uncommon.

It’s not because people are getting worse. It’s not because there is a secret cabal of villains pulling the strings.

It’s because the systems we live in are doing exactly what they were designed to do: **Select.**

They are selecting for the loudest voices, the most addictive content, and the most ruthless efficiencies. They are optimizing us, whether we like it or not.

But once you see the machine, you can stop hating the players. You can stop screaming at the symptoms. And maybe, just maybe, we can start talking about how to fix the game.
