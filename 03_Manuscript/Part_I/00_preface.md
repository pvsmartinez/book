# Preface: The Pattern

I’ve always been obsessed with how things work. 

I’m not an economist or a scientist. I’m just someone who likes to build things (software, companies, games) and watch what happens when people start using them. Since childhood, I've been building games, helping people immerse themselves in new worlds.

But when you spend enough time creating and balancing systems, you start to notice something strange. You start to see the same shapes repeating in places that shouldn't have anything in common.

You see the same logic you've fixed in a game being exploited in real life. You see how social media platforms are balanced like multiplayer games, and how those mechanics ripple out to affect the economy, businesses, and eventually, politics.

I began to notice that the way we consume news, the way we react to global crises, and even the way we train artificial intelligence all follow the same underlying rules.

And I call this **The Pattern**.

I want to show you how things seemingly unrelated all behave in similar ways. From biology to the economy, from politics to AI development.

This book isn't a textbook or a grand academic theory. It’s more like a pair of glasses. I want to share a lens that helped me make sense of why the world feels so loud, so fast, and so extreme right now. 

My goal here is not to give you the definitive truth of everything. Throughout this book, I will use simplified models and examples, like "The Cheetah" or "The Judge," to build a line of thought. These are tools for understanding, not perfect representations of reality. As in any system design process, we must simplify the complex to see the structure. I will raise more questions than I answer. But my hope is that by the end of these chapters, you’ll stop feeling like a passenger in a chaotic world and start seeing the levers. 

### A Note on Context

You should also know where I am standing. I am writing this from my own specific vantage point: that of a Brazilian computer scientist and game designer. You will find many examples drawn from the tech industry, video games, and the complex socio-economic reality of Brazil.

However, this book is not about Brazil, and it is not about computers. These are simply the raw materials I have to hand. The patterns themselves are universal. Whether you are a teacher in Tokyo, a farmer in Kansas, or an artist in Berlin, the underlying mechanics of incentives and selection apply to you just as much as they apply to a startup founder in São Paulo.

Finally, a word on politics. In an era of extreme polarization, it is impossible to write about systems without touching on political nerves. I have tried my best to remain an observer rather than a participant. I find myself often frustrated by the dogmas of both the political Left and Right, and I have no interest in scoring points for either team.

That said, true neutrality is a myth. My own biases will inevitably bleed through in the examples I choose and the framing I use. I ask you to look past them. Do not focus on whether you agree with my specific example of a tax policy or a social program. Focus on the *mechanism* I am describing. Focus on the Pattern.

I want to give you some theory as to how this system works, and some tools to dive deeper. Because once you understand the pattern, you can stop hating the players and start thinking about how to change the game. 

I hope that, after reading this book, you can use this foundation to see your own field with a new perspective. To see the flaws in the design.

At least that is my hope. Now it's up to you.

Let’s look at the mechanics.
