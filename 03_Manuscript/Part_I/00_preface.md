## Preface: The Pattern

I’ve always been obsessed with how things work.

I'm not an economist or a scientist. I'm a builder. I've spent my life creating games and products for others to play. Creating systems and experiences for others to try. I view the role of entertainment as inviting people to experience things they wouldn't otherwise experience. To live lives that are not theirs, and to feel and learn from moments they wouldn't normally have.

In the case of games and digital products, we are not just creating a passive medium, but something the user actively interacts with. This means we need to craft a system that, by design, invites the player to perform a behavior and rewards them with an emotion.

As we craft these systems, we slowly learn how behavior repeats itself. We see patterns emerging in places that shouldn't have anything in common.

I've started seeing these behaviors, these systemic consequences, everywhere. From how the news ecosystem evolved, to which YouTubers grew, to politics, or even to the pandemic. Observing how these unrelated topics changed over time, combined with my studies in machine learning and AI simulations, led me to see an underlying pattern across them.

Wherever there is action, feedback, and variation — optimization follows. I call this **The Pattern**.

It is not a new theory. It's a synthesis of many different topics, applied everywhere at once. The Pattern already exists under many names:

* Natural Selection (Biology)
* Reinforcement Learning (Computer Science)
* The Invisible Hand (Economics)
* Cybernetics (Norbert Wiener)
* Complex Adaptive Systems (Complexity Science)
* Goodhart’s Law (Metrics)
* The Red Queen Effect (Evolutionary Biology)
* Memetics (Richard Dawkins)

This book isn't a textbook or a grand academic theory. It’s a pair of glasses. I want to share a lens that helped me make sense of why the world feels so loud, so fast, and so extreme right now.

The pattern is not an underlying force that makes all those systems do what they do. It is closer to a mathematical lens on all these systems and on their consequences. It does not explain how or why something was optimized as it was. But it explains why, when a goal or external force filters individual actions, individuals, or attempts, optimization occurs and, with it, common patterns.

To explain and illustrate this theory to you, I will need to use simplified models and examples across dozens of topics, ranging from biological evolution and sociology to politics and career archetypes. This book is not meant to be the truth about everything, and in these examples, I will try to be neutral and present them as they are, without making value judgments. I'm not an expert in most of these, so please focus on the message of the pattern more than the example at hand.

### A Note on Context

You should also know where I am standing. I am writing this from my own specific vantage point: that of a Brazilian computer engineer and game designer. You will find many examples drawn from the tech industry, video games, and Brazil's complex socio-economic reality.

However, this book is not about Brazil or computers. These are simply the raw materials I have to hand. The patterns themselves are universal. Whether you are a teacher in Tokyo, a farmer in Kansas, or an artist in Berlin, the underlying mechanics of incentives and selection apply to you just as much as they apply to a startup founder in São Paulo.

Finally, a word on politics. In an era of extreme polarization, it is impossible to write about systems without touching on political nerves. I have tried my best to remain an observer rather than a participant. I find myself often frustrated by the dogmas of both the political Left and Right, and I have no interest in scoring points for either team.

That said, true neutrality is a myth. My own biases will inevitably bleed through in the examples I choose and the framing I use. I ask you to look past them. Do not focus on whether you agree with my specific example of a tax policy or a social program. Focus on the *mechanism* I am describing. Focus on the Pattern.

I want to give you some theory on how this system works and some tools to dive deeper.

I've been seeing so much discussion and hatred in the news, across so many different topics, that I hope that, after reading this book, you can avoid being caught in the river, in the algorithm—this force that shapes us—and use this foundation to see your own field with a new perspective.

At least that is my hope. Now it's up to you.
