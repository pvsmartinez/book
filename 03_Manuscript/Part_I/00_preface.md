## Preface: The Pattern

I’ve always been obsessed with how things work.

I'm not an economist or a scientist. I’m a builder. I’ve spent my life creating games and products for others to play. Creating systems and experiences for others to try. I view the role of entertainment as a way to invite people to experience what they wouldn't otherwise experience. To live lives that are not theirs, and to feel and learn from moments they wouldn't normally have.

In the case of games and digital products, we are not just creating a passive medium, but something the user actively interacts with. This means we need to craft a system that invites the player to perform a behavior, and rewards them with an emotion by design.

As we craft these systems, we slowly learn how behavior repeats itself. We see patterns emerging in places that shouldn't have anything in common.

I've started seeing these behaviors, these systemic consequences, everywhere. From how the news ecosystem evolved, to which YouTubers grew, to politics, or even to the pandemic. Observing how all these unrelated topics changed over time, combined with my studies in machine learning and AI simulations, led me to see one underlying rule in all of them.

I call this **The Pattern**.

This book isn't a textbook or a grand academic theory. It’s a pair of glasses. I want to share a lens that helped me make sense of why the world feels so loud, so fast, and so extreme right now.

The pattern is not an underlying force that makes all those systems do what they do. It is closer to a mathematical lens on all these systems, and a lens of its consequences. It does not explain how or why something optimized as it did. But it explains why, when we have individual actions, individuals or attempts, filtered by some goal or external force, optimization will occur, and with it some common patterns.

To explain and show this theory to you, I will have to use simplified models and examples for dozens of different topics, ranging from biological evolution, sociology, and politics to simplified career archetypes. This book is not meant to be the truth of everything, and through these examples I will try to be neutral and explain them as they are, trying to remove value judgments. I'm not an expert in most of these, so please focus on the message of the pattern more than the example at hand.

### A Note on Context

You should also know where I am standing. I am writing this from my own specific vantage point: that of a Brazilian computer engineer and game designer. You will find many examples drawn from the tech industry, video games, and the complex socio-economic reality of Brazil.

However, this book is not about Brazil, and it is not about computers. These are simply the raw materials I have to hand. The patterns themselves are universal. Whether you are a teacher in Tokyo, a farmer in Kansas, or an artist in Berlin, the underlying mechanics of incentives and selection apply to you just as much as they apply to a startup founder in São Paulo.

Finally, a word on politics. In an era of extreme polarization, it is impossible to write about systems without touching on political nerves. I have tried my best to remain an observer rather than a participant. I find myself often frustrated by the dogmas of both the political Left and Right, and I have no interest in scoring points for either team.

That said, true neutrality is a myth. My own biases will inevitably bleed through in the examples I choose and the framing I use. I ask you to look past them. Do not focus on whether you agree with my specific example of a tax policy or a social program. Focus on the *mechanism* I am describing. Focus on the Pattern.

I want to give you some theory as to how this system works, and some tools to dive deeper.

I've been seeing so much discussion and hatred in the news, across so many different topics, that I hope that, after reading this book, you can avoid being caught in the river, in the algorithm—this force that shapes us—and use this foundation to see your own field with a new perspective.

At least that is my hope. Now it's up to you.
