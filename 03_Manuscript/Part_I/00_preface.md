# Preface: The Pattern

I’ve always been fascinated by how things work. 

I’m not an economist or a scientist. I’m just someone who likes to build things—software, companies, games—and watch what happens when people start using them. Since childhood, I've been building games, helping people immerse themselves in new worlds and experience things they couldn't find in real life.

When you spend enough time creating and looking at systems, you start to notice something strange. You start to see the same shapes repeating in places that shouldn't have anything in common.

You see the same logic you've fixed in a game being exploited in real life. You see how social media platforms are balanced like multiplayer games, and how those mechanics ripple out to affect the economy, businesses, and eventually, politics.

I began to notice that the way we consume news, the way we react to global crises, and even the way we train artificial intelligence all follow the same underlying rules.

And I call this **The Pattern**.

I will argue in this book, slowly showing through examples, how things seemingly unrelated all behave in similar ways, and follow the same rules. From biology, economy, politics, gaming, AI development, social media and more.

This book isn't a textbook or a grand academic theory. It’s more like a pair of glasses. I want to share a lens that helped me make sense of why the world feels so loud, so fast, and so extreme right now. 

My goal here is not to give the answers, or to come up with the definitive truth of everything. I will even raise more questions than answer them. My hope is that by the end of these chapters, you’ll stop feeling like a passenger in a chaotic world and start seeing the levers. 

I want to give you some theory as to how this system works, and some tools to dive deeper into topics that matter to you. Because once you understand the pattern, you can stop hating the players and start thinking about how to change the game. I hope that, after reading this book, specialists on their respective fields can use this foundation to see their fields with a new perspective and bring improvements to a world that needs it. 

At least that is my hope. Now it's up to you.

Let’s take a look.
