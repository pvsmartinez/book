# Preface: The Pattern

I’ve always been fascinated by how things work. 

I’m not an economist or a scientist. I’m just someone who likes to build things—software, companies, games—and watch what happens when people start using them. When you spend enough time looking at systems, you start to notice something strange. You start to see the same shapes repeating in places that shouldn't have anything in common.

You see the same logic that makes a video go viral on TikTok also deciding who wins an election. You see the same "survival of the fittest" that shaped the giraffe’s neck also shaping the way your favorite local coffee shop has to run its business just to stay open.

I call this **The Pattern**.

This book isn't a textbook or a grand theory of everything. It’s more like a pair of glasses. I want to share a lens that helped me make sense of why the world feels so loud, so fast, and so extreme right now. 

It’s easy to look at the news and think the world is "broken" or that there are "evil" people behind every problem. But once you see the pattern, you realize that most of the time, the system isn't broken at all. It’s actually working perfectly—it’s just optimizing for things we didn't expect.

My hope is that by the end of these chapters, you’ll stop feeling like a passenger in a chaotic world and start seeing the levers. Because once you understand the pattern, you can stop hating the players and start thinking about how to change the game.

Let’s take a look.
