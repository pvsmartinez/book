## The Core Question
Why did Capitalism "win" over Socialism in the 20th Century?
*   **Answer:** **Incentives**.
*   Capitalism provides a direct feedback loop: Create Value $\rightarrow$ Capture Value (Profit).
*   This incentivizes innovation, risk-taking, and entrepreneurship.

## The Socialism Value Function
If you remove "Money" as the primary value function, the system doesn't stop having a hierarchy. It just swaps the metric.
*   **The New Metric:** **Power / Influence**.
*   **The Mechanism:**
    *   Someone still needs to govern/allocate resources.
    *   To get resources, you don't need to sell a product; you need to please the person with power.
    *   **Selection Pressure:** The system selects for those who are good at navigating bureaucracy and social hierarchies, not necessarily those who are good at producing goods.

## The "Why Nations Fail" Connection
*   **Capitalism (at its best):** Can be an **Inclusive Institution**. It allows anyone with a good idea to enter the market, compete, and succeed.
*   **Socialism (in practice):** Often becomes an **Extractive Institution**. A small elite (The Party) controls resources and extracts value from the population without allowing "Creative Destruction."

## Research Note
*   **Topic:** The Soviet Union.
*   **Goal:** Analyze the specific mechanisms of the Soviet economy through the lens of "Selection." How did the lack of price signals (the Value Function) lead to inefficiency?
*   *Note to self: Expand this section later with historical examples.*
