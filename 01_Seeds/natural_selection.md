# Natural Selection & Environmental Pressure

**Source:** Voice Transcript (Session 1)
**Related to:** [[power_of_selection]]

## Core Concept
Natural selection is the primary biological example of the "Power of Selection."
*   **Mechanism:** Iteration (generations) + Mutation + Selection (Survival of the Fittest).
*   **Key Insight:** Evolution is not about becoming "objectively better" (e.g., stronger/faster in a vacuum), but about becoming **more optimized for the specific environment**.

## The Environment as the Filter
The environment acts as the "selector" or filter for the iteration process.
*   **Example (Draft):**
    *   **High Food Abundance:** Species do not need to be efficient. They might prioritize size or reproduction speed over energy conservation.
    *   **Low Food Abundance:** Species *must* evolve efficiency. Those who waste energy die. The environment "selects" for efficiency.
    *   *Note:* The user wants to refine this example later. It is currently a "quick dumb example" to illustrate the point.

## Connection to Central Theme
This illustrates that "Selection" requires:
1.  **Volume/Iteration:** Many generations (breeding, dying).
2.  **Variation:** Mutation (random changes).
3.  **Constraint:** The Environment (the thing that kills the unfit).

## Connections
*   **[[machine_learning_selection]]:** The "Environment" in nature plays the same role as the "Value Function" in AI. Both act as the filter for optimization.
