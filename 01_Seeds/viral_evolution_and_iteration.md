# Viral Evolution and Iteration

## The Value Function: Transmission
*   **Goal**: A virus (living or not) has one simple value function: **Spread**.
*   **Key Metrics**:
    *   **Contagion Rate (R0)**: How many people does one person infect?
    *   **Incubation Period**: How long before symptoms appear? (Longer = better for spread, as the host moves around unknowingly).
    *   **Lethality**: Too high, and the host dies before spreading. Too low, and it might not replicate enough.

## Case Study: COVID-19
*   **The Perfect Storm**: High contagion + long asymptomatic period.
*   **The Iteration**:
    *   Humans introduced **Vaccines** and **Quarantine** (changed the Environment).
    *   The Virus **Mutated** (Iterated).
    *   **Result**: Variants like Delta and Omicron became *more* contagious to bypass the new barriers.
*   **Speed**: Because viruses replicate billions of times in a short period, they "learn" (adapt) incredibly fast.

## Case Study: Insects and Pesticides
*   **The Pesticide Treadmill**:
    *   Humans spray poison. 99% of insects die.
    *   The 1% that survive have a random mutation that resists the poison.
    *   They reproduce. The next generation is 100% resistant.
    *   Humans invent a new poison. The cycle repeats.
*   **Timeline**: Resistance often appears in 2-20 years (sometimes as fast as 3 years).
*   **Lesson**: You cannot "solve" a pest problem with a static tool if the pest is capable of iteration. You are just breeding a stronger pest.

## Non-Living Selection
*   **The Insight**: Selection pressures apply to *anything* that replicates, not just biological life.
    *   **Viruses**: (Debatable if alive).
    *   **Computer Viruses**: Code that spreads.
    *   **Ideas (Memes)**: Thoughts that spread.
*   The "Mind" is not required. The **System** does the thinking through the filter of survival.
