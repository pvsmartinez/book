# Ideas as Viruses (Memetics)

## Non-Living Selection
*   **The Concept**: Ideas (or "Memes" in the Dawkins sense) are not alive, but they behave like living things in a selection system.
*   **The Value Function**: **Spread/Replication**.
    *   An idea doesn't need to be *true* to spread. It just needs to be *contagious*.
    *   It needs to be easy to remember, easy to repeat, or trigger a strong emotional reaction (fear, outrage, hope).

## The Mechanism
1.  **Host**: The human mind.
2.  **Transmission**: Speech, writing, internet.
3.  **Mutation**: As ideas are retold, they change. The versions that are "stickier" survive; the boring details are forgotten.
4.  **Selection**: The "fittest" ideas (not necessarily the best ones) dominate the culture.

## Connection to "The System"
*   Just like a virus doesn't "want" to kill you (it just wants to spread), a bad idea doesn't "want" to ruin society. It just spreads because the environment (e.g., Social Media) selects for it.
