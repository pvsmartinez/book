# Seed: Game Theory & The Evolution of Behavior

**Core Concept:** Game Theory is not just about "Games"; it is the mathematics of interaction. It explains how the "Value Function" of an individual is shaped dynamically by the **Environment** (Payoffs) and the **Competitors** (Strategies).

## Key Components

### 1. The Payoff Matrix (The Value Function)
*   Game Theory visualizes the Value Function as a grid. 
*   The "Score" you get doesn't just depend on your move; it depends on the other player's move.
*   **Insight:** The "Environment" sets the numbers in the grid (e.g., how much food is available? How deadly is the fight?).

### 2. The Prisoner's Dilemma (The Introduction)
*   **Scenario:** Two prisoners. Trust vs. Betrayal.
*   **Lesson:** Rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so. The "Nash Equilibrium" (both betray) is a trap where the system optimizes to a sub-optimal state for the group.

### 3. Hawks vs. Doves (The Deep Dive)
*   **Origin:** John Maynard Smith (*The Selfish Gene* context).
*   **Strategies:**
    *   **Hawk:** Always fight. Risks injury (-100) for a chance at food (+50).
    *   **Dove:** Threaten, but retreat if challenged. Never injured (0), but shares food if meets another Dove (+25).
*   **The Dynamic:**
    *   In a population of all Doves, a single Hawk becomes king (wins everything, no risk).
    *   In a population of all Hawks, everyone is injured (negative sum).
    *   **The Oscillation:** The system swings until it hits an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS)—a ratio of Hawks and Doves.

### 4. The Local Maximum Trap
*   **Global Maximum:** Everyone is a Dove. Peace. High total value.
*   **Local Maximum (Nash Equilibrium):** A mix of Hawks and Doves. Violence exists. Lower total value.
*   **The Lesson:** The Pattern optimizes for the *Stable* strategy, not the *Best* strategy. Evolution is blind to the "Greater Good"; it only sees the immediate payoff of the interaction.

## Integration Points
*   **Part III:** Explains how the Value Function is dynamic.
*   **Part IV (Pendulum):** Explains why systems oscillate (Hawk/Dove ratios).
*   **Part V (System Design):** Modeling interactions is a key tool for the "Gardener."
