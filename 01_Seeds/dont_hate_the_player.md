## Core Metaphor
This phrase is a potential **TL;DR for the entire book**.
*   **The Player:** The individual agent (person, company, organism).
*   **The Game:** The System, Environment, Algorithm, or Value Function.

## The Insight
We often blame the "Player" for their behavior, but they are simply optimizing for the rules of the "Game."
*   If a politician is corrupt, it's because the political system selects for corruption.
*   If a CEO is greedy, it's because the market selects for profit maximization.
*   **Conclusion:** To change the outcome, you cannot just change the players (vote for a new guy); you must change the **Game** (the incentives/algorithm).

## Connection to "Selection"
*   The "Game" is the **Selection Mechanism**.
*   The "Player" is the result of **Iteration** through that mechanism.
