# Evolutionary Arms Races

## The Red Queen Effect
*   "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."
*   In a competitive system, if your opponent improves, you *must* improve just to survive.

## Examples
*   **Predator vs. Prey**:
    *   Cheetahs get faster -> Gazelles get faster.
    *   *Reset*: The asteroid hit (Environment Change). Being big/fast didn't matter. Being small/stealthy (Mammals) became the new meta.
*   **Cops vs. Robbers**:
    *   Better locks -> Better lockpicks.
    *   Better alarms -> Smarter heists.
*   **Cybersecurity**:
    *   Hackers find an exploit -> Patch released -> Hackers find a new exploit.
    *   It is a "Cat and Mouse" game that never ends, only evolves.

## The Trap
*   You can never "win" an arms race, you can only stay ahead.
*   The moment you stop iterating, you lose.
*   **Escalation**: Arms races tend to consume more and more resources (energy, money, time) just to maintain the status quo.
