# The Invisible Hand vs. The Invisible Pattern

**Core Concept:** Adam Smith's "Invisible Hand" is just one specific instance of "The Pattern" (Selection). It works perfectly in specific environments (perfect competition, many small players, rational actors) but breaks down when the environment changes (monopolies, externalities, information asymmetry).

## The Mechanism
*   **The Invisible Hand:** In a free market, individual self-interest leads to societal benefit.
    *   *Why it works:* Competition acts as the **Filter**. If you make bad bread, you go out of business. If you charge too much, you go out of business.
    *   *The Result:* Optimization for price and quality.

## When It Breaks
*   **The Pattern continues, but the outcome changes.**
*   When a player gets too big (Monopoly), they can change the **Environment** (buy competitors, lobby for laws).
*   The "Invisible Hand" stops selecting for "Better Bread" and starts selecting for "Better Moats" or "Better Lobbying."
*   **Key Insight:** The Pattern never stops. Selection never stops. But if the environment changes from "Competition" to "Consolidation," the Invisible Hand starts strangling the market instead of feeding it.

## Connection to Title
*   "The Invisible Pattern" is the superset. "The Invisible Hand" is just one subset.
