# The Salesman Evolution

**Core Concept:** The "Salesman Archetype" (charming, persuasive, good communicator) is not a result of a global conspiracy or a secret school, but an emergent behavior shaped by the environment.

## The Mechanism
1.  **The Environment:** To survive as a salesman, you must close deals.
2.  **The Filter:** People buy from those they trust, like, or are persuaded by.
3.  **Iteration:** Every sales pitch is an attempt.
4.  **Feedback:**
    *   Sale made = Positive feedback (Do this again).
    *   Door slammed = Negative feedback (Don't do this again).
5.  **Variance:** Each salesperson tries slightly different tactics. Some are naturally more aggressive, some more empathetic.

## The Result
Over time (generations or just career span), the "Salesman" evolves. The ones who didn't adapt left the profession. The ones who remained share similar traits because those are the traits that *survived* the filter.

## Application
This applies to everything:
*   Politicians (need votes -> become populist or charismatic).
*   CEOs (need shareholder value -> become ruthless or visionary).
*   YouTubers (need clicks -> become loud or clickbaity).

It's not "Evil People." It's "Optimized Survivors."
