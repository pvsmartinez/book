## The Shift in Value Function
Capitalism is an optimization algorithm, but the "Value Function" (what it optimizes for) has mutated over the last century.

### Phase 1: The Profit Era (Early Capitalism)
*   **Mechanism:** Entrepreneur has an idea $\rightarrow$ Builds product $\rightarrow$ Sells to customer $\rightarrow$ Profit.
*   **The Metric:** **Profit**.
*   **Selection Pressure:** You survive if you make more money than you spend.
*   **Investor Role:** Passive. "I have money, you have ideas. I'll fund you for a share of the profits."

### Phase 2: The Growth Era (Venture Capital)
*   **Mechanism:** Entrepreneur has an idea $\rightarrow$ Raises money $\rightarrow$ Burns money to grow fast $\rightarrow$ Dominates market $\rightarrow$ Eventually profits.
*   **The Metric:** **Growth / Market Share**.
*   **Selection Pressure:** You survive if you can grow fast enough to justify the next round of funding.
*   **The Shift:** Profit is delayed. "Burn rate" is acceptable if growth is high.

### Phase 3: The Valuation Era (The Bubble / "Ponzi" Dynamics)
*   **Mechanism:** Entrepreneur has a *narrative* $\rightarrow$ Raises money $\rightarrow$ Increases Valuation $\rightarrow$ Raises *more* money based on higher valuation.
*   **The Metric:** **Valuation / Fundraising Ability**.
*   **Selection Pressure:** You survive if you can **convince investors**.
*   **The Perverse Incentive:**
    *   The product doesn't need to make a profit; it needs to be "investable."
    *   Investment becomes an end in itself.
    *   Early investors don't need the company to profit; they need a *later* investor to buy them out at a higher price.
    *   **Result:** A system that selects for "Marketing-First" entrepreneurs (like politicians) rather than "Product-First" entrepreneurs.

### Phase 4: The Crowding Effect (The "Recession" Filter)
*   **The Problem:** When the market is flooded with VC money, "Fundraising-First" startups can outspend "Product-First" startups on marketing and distribution.
*   **The Death of the Middle:** A sustainable, product-led company might die simply because it cannot compete with the *noise* and *ad spend* of a VC-backed competitor, even if the competitor has a worse product.
*   **The "Recession" Counter-Argument:**
    *   However, when the bubble bursts (or funding dries up), the "Fundraising-First" companies die.
    *   The *truly* exceptional product companies survive (like strong species during a drought).
    *   **Result:** This is good for the consumer in the long run (only good products remain), but the process is brutal and kills many "good enough" sustainable businesses in the crossfire.

## Emergent Behavior: The Concentration
*   **The Feedback Loop:**
    *   If you raise a lot of money, you are "validated."
    *   Because you are validated, it's safer for others to invest in you.
    *   You get *more* money.
    *   **Result:** Massive concentration of capital in a few "Winners" (e.g., The Magnificent 7, AI Bubble) while smaller, profitable businesses starve.
*   **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:** Reality (current results) matters less than the *Promise* (future potential).

## Conclusion
We haven't just "optimized" capitalism; we've changed the target. We are no longer selecting for efficient businesses; we are selecting for efficient *fundraising machines*.
