# Identity as Feedback

**Core Concept:**
Identity is not a fixed input; it is a **calcified output**.
The Value Function (Environment) provides constant feedback on our actions.
*   Action $\to$ Reward $\to$ Repeat.
*   Action $\to$ Punishment $\to$ Stop.

Over thousands of iterations, this feedback loop "sculpts" us. We become the shape that fits the mold.

## The Mechanism
1.  **The Feedback Loop:** Every interaction with the world (Rules, Track, Competitors) returns a signal.
    *   *Rules:* You get a bad grade (Punishment).
    *   *Track:* You slip on the ice (Physical Feedback).
    *   *Competitors:* You get laughed at (Social Feedback).
2.  **Accumulation:** These signals aren't just data points; they are chisel strikes. They shape your habits, your fears, and your desires.
3.  **Calcification:** Eventually, the "Adaptation" becomes "Identity." You say "I am a shy person," but really, you are just an organism that was punished for speaking up in a specific environment.

## Application
*   **Atomic Habits Connection:** This is the deep mechanic behind specific habit formation.
*   **Changing Context:** Why is it easier to change behavior in a new city? Because the feedback loop is severed. The mold is gone, so the liquid (you) can take a new shape.
*   **The 5 Friends:** They are the glues that hold your current shape in place.

**Placement Proposal:**
This connects "The Engine" (Part II) to "The Direction" (Part III). It shows that the Direction *changes the Engine*.
