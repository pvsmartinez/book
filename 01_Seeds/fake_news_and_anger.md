# Fake News and Anger Algorithms

## The Value Function: Engagement
*   **The Goal**: Social media platforms want you to stay on the app (to see ads).
*   **The Metric**: Engagement (Likes, Comments, Shares, Time Spent).

## The Selection Pressure
*   **Emotion**: Content that triggers high-arousal emotions (Anger, Fear, Outrage) generates more engagement than content that triggers low-arousal emotions (Sadness, Contentment).
*   **Fake News**: False stories are often designed specifically to trigger these emotions. They are "hyper-optimized" for the algorithm.
*   **Truth**: The truth is often boring, nuanced, or complex. It has a lower "viral coefficient."

## The Consequence
*   **The Algorithm's Choice**: If an algorithm is neutral and only cares about engagement, it will *always* promote polarizing lies over boring truths.
*   **No Malice Required**: The platform doesn't want to destroy democracy; it just wants you to comment. But the side effect is the amplification of division.
*   **Reference**: *Stolen Focus* (Johann Hari) discusses this mechanism in depth.
