# Iteration is Feedback

**Core Concept:** Iteration is not just repetition. It is **Action + Feedback**.

## The Misconception
People think "practice makes perfect." But practicing the wrong thing 10,000 times just makes you perfectly wrong.

## The Definition
*   **Action:** You do something (kick a ball, write a line of code, tell a joke).
*   **Feedback:** The universe (or a system) tells you the result.
    *   *Binary:* Success/Fail.
    *   *Gradient:* Better/Worse.
    *   *Complex:* "They laughed, but at the wrong part."

## Examples
*   **Dog Training:**
    *   Action: Dog sits.
    *   Feedback: Cookie (Positive).
    *   Result: Dog sits more often.
    *   *Without Feedback:* If you never gave the cookie, the dog wouldn't learn "Sit." It would just be random movement.
*   **School:**
    *   Action: Homework.
    *   Feedback: Grades/Red pen.
    *   *The Trap:* If feedback is slow (only one exam a year), iteration is slow, and learning is slow.

## Formula
**Speed of Adaptation = Frequency of Iteration x Quality of Feedback.**
