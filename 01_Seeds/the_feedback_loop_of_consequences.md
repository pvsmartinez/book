# The Feedback Loop of Consequences

## The Cycle
1.  **System Design**: Someone creates a system (e.g., "University Exams").
2.  **Selection**: The environment filters for winners (e.g., "Schools that teach to the test").
3.  **Consequences**: Unintended side effects emerge (e.g., "Students lack financial literacy").
4.  **Differentiation**: A subset of players adapts to exploit the gap (e.g., "Elite schools teaching soft skills").
5.  **New Elite**: These players become the new leaders.
6.  **System Update**: The new leaders change the rules (e.g., "Let's change the Exam").
7.  **Repeat**: The cycle starts again with new consequences.

## The Lesson
*   **Dynamic Environments**: The environment is never static. The *winners* of the last round change the *rules* of the next round.
*   **No End State**: There is no "perfect" system, only the current iteration of the loop.
