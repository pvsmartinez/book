# Society Is Not Optimized for Happiness

**Core Concept:**
We often assume that as civilization advances, it *should* become better for human well-being. We assume the "Goal" of history is Happiness.
But history is not a Happiness Maximizer. It is a Power Maximizer.

## The Evolution of Societies
Societies compete with other societies.
*   **Society A:** Focuses on leisure, art, and happiness.
*   **Society B:** Focuses on military production, relentless work, and expansion.

In a conflict, Society B conquers Society A.
The traits of Society B (Expansion, Aggression, Industry) interact with the Value Function of History (Survival of the Fittest Group).
The "traits" of Society A (Happiness, Leisure) are deleted.

## The Disconnect
This means we can end up living in a civilization that is incredibly "successful" (High GDP, massive military, global influence) but where the individual experience is miserable (High anxiety, low connection).
Happiness is often a **byproduct**, not the **target**.
Optimism requires us to intervene. If we want happiness, we must *design* for it, because the default Value Function of history will not give it to us for free.
