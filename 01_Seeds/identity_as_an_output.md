# Identity is an Output of the Value Function

**Core Concept:**
We often think of our "Identity" or "Habits" as things that come from *inside* us (Willpower).
But if we apply the Pattern (Iteration + Feedback), we see that behavior is shaped by the feedback loops of our environment.

## The Mechanism
1.  **Action:** You tell a joke.
2.  **Feedback:** Your friends laugh (Reward) or stare in silence (Punishment).
3.  **Adaptation:** You iterate. You become "The Funny Guy" or you stop telling jokes.

Over time, these loops calcify into "Personality."

## The Impact of Environment (The Track)
*   **Changing Locations:** Why is it easier to quit smoking when you move to a new city? Because the "Triggers" (The Track) and the "Peers" (The Feedback) are gone. The feedback loop is broken, allowing for a restart.
*   **The 5 Friends Rule:** "You are the average of the 5 people closest to you." Why? Because they are your immediate **Value Function**. They are the Judge that provides the most frequent feedback. If they reward cynicism, you become cynical. If they reward ambition, you become ambitious.

## Application
To change yourself, you often have to change your Value Function (your context/peers) rather than just "trying harder" (Variance).
