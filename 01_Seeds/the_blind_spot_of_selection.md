# The Blind Spot of Selection

**Core Concept:**
Natural Selection (and any Value Function) does not optimize for "Good" or "Bad." It only optimizes for the specific win condition. Everything that happens *outside* that condition is invisible to the system.

## The Biological Blind Spot
Why do humans go bald? Why do we get Alzheimer's?
We might assume these are "flaws" in our design. But natural selection isn't a designer trying to create a perfect being. It is a filter trying to create a *reproductive* being.
*   **The Win Condition:** Survive long enough to reproduce and raise offspring.
*   **The Result:** Traits that manifest *after* this window are "invisible" to the judge.
*   If a gene makes you incredibly strong at age 20 but causes you to explode at age 80, that gene will spread. The "explosion" is a byproduct that the system simply doesn't care about.

## The Selection Window
The Value Function has a "window of relevance."
*   If you are optimizing a company for "Quarterly Profits," you are blind to "10-Year Brand Reputation."
*   If you are optimizing a code base for "Speed of Shipping," you are blind to "Technical Debt."

These aren't errors. They are accurate executions of a narrow ruleset. The "Bad" outcomes are just byproducts of the "Good" optimization.
