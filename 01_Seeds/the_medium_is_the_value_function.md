# The Medium is the Value Function

**Status:** Seed
**Concept:** The business model and distribution platform of a medium act as its primary Value Function, shaping the content more than the creator's intent.

## Key Observations
*   **Games:** Mobile games (optimized for Whales/Microtransactions) vs. PC games (optimized for fair play/one-time purchase) vs. Console games (optimized for cinematic experience). The platform dictates the design.
*   **TV/Series:** 
    *   *Broadcast TV:* Optimized for weekly viewing. Result: Episodic "Case of the Week" (Police procedurals, Sitcoms like *Friends*) with light overarching stories.
    *   *Streaming:* Optimized for binge-watching. Result: Serialized "10-hour movies" where episodes bleed into each other, fewer cliffhangers per episode, more focus on the long narrative arc.
*   **Movies:** 
    *   *The Cinema Trap:* As home streaming improves, cinemas must optimize for "The Experience." Result: Blockbusters, 3D, VFX-heavy spectacles, and luxury seating. The "mid-budget" movie (Romantic Comedies) migrates to streaming because it doesn't fit the cinema's new Value Function.
*   **News:** 
    *   *Local Newspapers:* Optimized for community relevance and subscription.
    *   *Social Media (TikTok/YouTube):* Optimized for the algorithm's engagement metrics. Result: Sensationalism, quick cuts, and "Anger Engines."

## The Core Realization
Creators often start with similar backgrounds and tastes, but they are "sculpted" by the medium. The business model is the "Judge." If you change the way a creator gets paid (the Value Function), you change the art they produce.
