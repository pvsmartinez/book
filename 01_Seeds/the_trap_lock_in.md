# Seed: The Trap (Path Dependence & Lock-In)

**Tags:** [[time_and_compounding]], [[system_design]], [[infrastructure]]

## The Concept
The longer a system iterates in one direction, the harder it becomes to change direction, even if a better path exists. The "cost of switching" compounds alongside the efficiency.

## The Mechanism
1.  **Early Adoption:** A standard is chosen (often randomly or for a specific temporary reason).
2.  **Network Effect:** More people use it, so more infrastructure is built around it.
3.  **Lock-In:** The cost to switch becomes higher than the benefit of the better alternative.
4.  **The Trap:** We are stuck using "sub-optimal" tools (QWERTY, Fossil Fuels, Imperial System) because the system has optimized *around* the error.

## Examples
*   **QWERTY Keyboard:** Designed to slow down typists so mechanical keys wouldn't jam. Now, in the digital age, we still use it because retraining billions of people is too "expensive."
*   **Infrastructure:** Cities built for cars (suburbs) cannot easily switch to public transport. The physical concrete "locks in" the lifestyle.
*   **Legacy Code:** Old banking software (COBOL) runs the world. It's terrible, but replacing it is too risky.
*   **"Too Big to Fail":** Institutions that become so integrated into the system that the system cannot allow them to die, effectively stopping natural selection.

## Application to the Book
*   **Part IV (The Compounder):** This explains the feeling of "Stuckness." Why can't we just fix the education system? Because the entire economy is built around the "Credential" signal.
*   **Contrast:** Accumulation is about *speeding up*. Lock-In is about *hardening*.
