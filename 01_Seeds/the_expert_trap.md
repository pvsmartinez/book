# The Expert Trap (10,000 Hours vs. Feedback)

**Core Concept:** You only become an expert if you have **Feedback**. Doing something for 10,000 hours without feedback doesn't make you an expert; it makes you a habit-machine.

## The Feedback Loop
*   **Valid Expertise:** Tennis, Jazz, Chess, Surgery.
    *   *Why:* Immediate, clear feedback. You play a wrong note, you hear it. You make a bad move, you lose.
    *   *Result:* The brain optimizes.

## The "Fake" Experts
*   **Invalid Expertise:** Stock Pickers, Political Pundits, Geopolitical Analysts.
    *   *Why:* Feedback is noisy, delayed, or non-existent.
    *   *The Trap:* If you predict a recession and it happens 2 years later, was it your prediction or luck? If you pick a stock and it goes up, was it skill or a bull market?

## The Selection Pressure (Why they exist)
*   If they aren't selected for "Accuracy" (because accuracy is impossible to measure), what are they selected for?
*   **Financial Consultants:** Selected for **Authority** and **Safety**. They sell "sleep at night," not "alpha."
*   **Political Pundits:** Selected for **Clarity** and **Persuasion**. They sell "narrative," not "truth."
*   **The Insight:** They *are* experts. Just not at what you think. They are expert *persuaders*, not expert *predictors*.
