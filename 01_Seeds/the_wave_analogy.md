# The Wave Analogy (Energy vs. Matter)

## The Physics
*   **The Illusion:** When you watch a wave crashing onto the shore, it looks like the water is moving forward from the deep ocean to the sand.
*   **The Reality:** The water molecules are mostly moving up and down in place. The *water* stays; the *energy* travels.
*   **Definition:** A wave is a disturbance (information/energy) propagating through a medium (matter).

## Application to Memetics
*   **The Medium:** Society (The collection of individual minds).
*   **The Wave:** The Meme (The Idea, The Trend, The Culture).
*   **The Mechanic:**
    *   You tell a friend an idea.
    *   You function as the "Atom" that vibrates.
    *   Your friend receives the energy and vibrates (repeats it).
    *   The "Idea" travels through the network, but the people stay where they are.

## The Host as Vehicle
*   **Biology:** The Gene uses the Body as a vehicle to move through time.
*   **Culture:** The Meme uses the Mind as a vehicle to move through the population.
*   **Substrate Independence:**
    *   Sound waves = Energy through Air.
    *   Ocean waves = Energy through Water.
    *   Culture = Information through Neurons.
    *   The *Pattern* is the wave, not the water.

## Key Insight for the Book
*   This removes the "magic" or "spooky" nature of viral ideas. It's just physics.
*   It explains why "movements" seem to have a life of their own. The wave has momentum that is separate from any single drop of water.
*   If you stop the water from moving (censorship/isolation), the wave dies. The medium is required for the message.
