# Time and Compounding

## The System: Interest Rates
*   **Context (Brazil 2025)**:
    *   **SELIC Rate**: ~15% per year.
    *   **Minimum Wage**: ~1,509 BRL/month (~19,600 BRL/year with 13th salary).
*   **The Scenario**:
    *   **Person A (The Worker)**: Works all year to earn ~19,600 BRL.
    *   **Person B (The Saver)**: Has 100,000 BRL invested. Does nothing.

## The Math of Divergence
*   **Year 1**:
    *   Person A earns **19,600 BRL** (Labor).
    *   Person B earns **15,000 BRL** (Interest).
    *   *Status*: The worker still earns more, but the saver earned 76% of a full-time salary for zero effort.
*   **Year 5 (Compounding)**:
    *   Person B's capital has grown to ~201,000 BRL.
    *   **Interest in Year 5**: ~30,000 BRL.
    *   *Status*: Person B now earns **1.5x** the worker's salary (assuming wage stagnation) by doing nothing.
*   **The Gap**:
    *   If Person B started with **100,000 USD** (~600,000 BRL), the annual interest would be **90,000 BRL**—equivalent to **4.5 minimum wage workers** from Day 1.

## Time as a Selection Filter
*   **The Lever**: Time.
*   **The Selection**: The system selects for *existing capital*.
*   **Consequence**: Divergence. The gap between those with capital and those without doesn't just stay the same; it widens exponentially.
*   **The "Error"**: What seems like a fair system (everyone gets 15%) becomes an impossible barrier over time. A worker starting from zero can never catch up to the exponential curve of the capital holder.

## The Limit of Compounding (Oscillation vs. Extremism)
Compounding doesn't always go up forever. It interacts with the environment.
*   **Static Environment:** Leads to **Extremism**. (e.g., The Cheetah getting faster until it's too fragile).
*   **Dynamic Environment:** Leads to **Oscillation**. (e.g., Fashion trends swinging back and forth).
*   *See:* [[shifting_value_functions]] for how the environment reacts to compounding.

## Environment Feedback
*   **Why doesn't it break?** If this continued for 500 years, one person would own everything.
*   **Correction Mechanisms**: The environment changes.
    *   Inflation devalues the currency.
    *   Taxes/Regulation.
    *   Social Unrest/Revolution.
    *   The "Game" resets or rules change when the inequality becomes unsustainable.
