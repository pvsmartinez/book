# Venice and the Calcification of Growth

**Status:** Seed
**Core Concept:** How inclusive systems can turn extractive over time due to the compounding of power. Success creates oligarchies, which then close the door behind them.

---

## 1. The Rise (The Commenda)
*   Venice in the Middle Ages was remarkably inclusive for its time.
*   **The Innovation:** The *Commenda* contract.
    *   It allowed anyone with capital to invest in a trading voyage, and anyone with guts (but no money) to be the sailor/merchant.
    *   It was "Venture Capital for the masses."
*   **The Result:** A massive explosion of social mobility. New families became rich. The pie grew for everyone. Venice became a superpower.

## 2. The Compounding (The Head Start)
*   The families that won big in the early days accumulated massive wealth.
*   Wealth = Political Power.
*   They naturally wanted to protect their gains. They didn't want to compete with the *next* wave of upstarts.

## 3. The Fall (La Serrata)
*   **The Closing:** Starting in 1297, with the "Serrata" (The Closure).
    *   They passed laws banning the *Commenda*.
    *   They restricted the Great Council to only existing noble families.
    *   They effectively pulled up the ladder.
*   **The Logic:** "Refusal to Iterate." They tried to freeze the system in a state where they were on top.
*   **The Consequence:**
    *   Social mobility died.
    *   Innovation died.
    *   Venice turned from a dynamic trade empire into a "Museum" for the rich.
    *   They stopped optimizing for growth and started optimizing for preservation.

## 4. The Lesson
*   **Success makes you Extractive.** The winners of an inclusive game have a strong incentive to rig the next round of the game.
*   **The Trap:** Compounding doesn't just compound money; it compounds the ability to change the rules.
*   This is why "Laissez-faire" markets often end in monopoly unless checks are in place. The Invisible Hand gets handcuffed by the winners.
