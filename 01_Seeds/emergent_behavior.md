# Emergent Behavior
**Definition**: Complex patterns or outcomes that arise from the interaction of smaller, simpler components, often without being explicitly planned or designed.

## Key Components
*   **Components**: The individual parts of a system (e.g., users, servers, code, money).
*   **Environment**: The rules and constraints (e.g., "Must make a profit," "Internet is fast").
*   **Interaction**: How the components fit together.

## Examples
*   **The Internet**: Started as a free sharing platform -> Emerged into an Attention Economy because of the need for revenue + the "Free" constraint.
*   **Traffic**: Individual cars trying to get home fast -> Traffic jams (emergent property).
*   **Ant Colonies**: Simple individual ants -> Complex colony structures.

## The "No Conspiracy" Rule
*   Bad outcomes (addiction, polarization) are often *emergent properties* of the system's incentives, not the result of a secret evil plan.
*   "Individuals are just doing their own thing." The system filters what survives.
