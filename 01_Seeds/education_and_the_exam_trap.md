# Education and the Exam Trap

## The Value Function: Passing Exams
*   **The Goal**: Parents want their children to succeed (get into University).
*   **The Metric**: University Entrance Exams (e.g., ENEM in Brazil, SAT in US).
*   **The Selection**:
    *   Schools that focus 100% on the Exam get better results.
    *   Schools that teach "Life Skills" (Financial Literacy, Citizenship) get worse Exam results.
    *   Parents select the "Exam Schools."
    *   "Life Skills Schools" go out of business or adapt.

## Emergent Behavior: The Curriculum
*   **The Outcome**: A generation that knows how to solve specific academic problems but may lack basic financial or emotional intelligence.
*   **Not a Conspiracy**: No one *decided* "Let's make kids bad with money." It emerged because Financial Literacy isn't on the test.

## The Elite Differentiation (The Feedback Loop)
*   **Differentiation**: Once *everyone* is optimized for exams, "Elite" schools need a new selling point. They start teaching "Soft Skills," "Citizenship," and "Critical Thinking" (often leaning Left/Progressive).
*   **The "Caviar Left"**:
    *   Rich students get the "Holistic" education (Exams + Values).
    *   Poor students get the "Factory" education (Exams only).
    *   **Result**: A wealthy class that is culturally progressive/left-leaning, while the working class is focused on pragmatic survival/exams.
*   **The Loop**: These wealthy, progressive graduates enter politics/bureaucracy and eventually change the Exams to include these new values, forcing the whole system to shift again.

## Consequences
*   **The Error Compounds**: The gap isn't just knowledge; it's cultural. The rich and poor end up with completely different worldviews because their educational *selection pressures* were different.
