# Capitalism as an Optimization Algorithm

## Core Concept
Capitalism is not just an economic system; it is an **optimization algorithm** that runs over time.
*   **The Value Function:** Capital Accumulation (Profit).
*   **The Trend:** Over time, the system becomes *more optimized* for this goal, leading to inevitable **Wealth Concentration**.

## The "Exponential Curve" Hypothesis
The user posits a relationship between **Population Size** and **Wealth Inequality**.
*   **Hypothesis:** The exponential curve of wealth concentration scales with the number of participants.
    *   *Small Group:* The richest person can only be so much richer than the poorest.
    *   *Large Group:* As the population grows, the "tail" of the distribution gets longer. The richest individual accumulates a vastly larger percentage of power/wealth relative to the average.
*   **Key Insight:** "Richness" (Wealth/Power) concentration is a feature of the algorithm, not a bug. As time passes (Iteration), the system naturally selects for extreme accumulation unless the "Game" is changed.

## Language Note
*   *User's term:* "Revenue more merit concentrate" $\rightarrow$ **Wealth Concentration / Capital Accumulation**.
*   *User's term:* "Richness" $\rightarrow$ **Wealth / Power**.
