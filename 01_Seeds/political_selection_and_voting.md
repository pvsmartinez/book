# Political Selection and Voting

## The Value Function: Votes
In the domain of politics, specifically democracies, the **Value Function** is clear: **Votes**.
To enter the system and stay in the system, an agent (politician) must maximize this metric.

## Selection Pressures
Just as nature selects for survival and reproduction, the political system selects for traits that generate votes.
*   **Communication skills**: Ability to explain (or seem to explain) complex topics.
*   **Charisma/Extroversion**: Building relationships, remembering names, "kissing babies."
*   **Marketing**: The ability to sell an image or an idea.

## Path Dependence and Specialization
*   **Lock-in**: Once an individual enters the political "game," they optimize for it. It becomes harder to pivot to other careers (like a doctor becoming a lawyer).
*   **Reinforcement**: As they stay in power, they get better at the specific skills required to *stay* in power (understanding the rules, networking, campaigning).
*   **Career Politicians**: This creates a class of agents hyper-optimized for the specific value function of the system, sometimes at the expense of other skills (like actual governance or technical expertise, unless those also generate votes).

## The "Game" Determines the Winner
*   "Don't hate the player, hate the game."
*   The profile of the typical politician is not random; it is the inevitable result of the selection pressure applied by the voting system.
*   If the rules of the game reward polarization, we get polarized politicians. If it rewards consensus, we get consensus builders.

## The Changing Environment: The Internet
*   The environment in which this selection happens is changing.
*   The Internet alters how votes are gathered (marketing, social media, virality).
*   This changes the *traits* that are selected for. A politician successful in the TV era might not be successful in the TikTok era.
