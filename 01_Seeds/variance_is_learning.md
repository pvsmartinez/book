# Variance is Learning

**Core Concept:** Variance is the "difference in attempts." Without variance, you cannot learn, because you have nothing to compare.

## The Definition
*   **Variance:** The deviation from the norm or the previous attempt.
*   **The Quote:** "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." (Einstein/folklore).
    *   *In our context:* If you have zero variance, you are "insane" by this definition. You are stuck.

## Examples
*   **Tennis:** You never hit the ball *exactly* the same way twice. Your muscles have micro-variance. This allows your brain to feel "Oh, that one felt better."
*   **Sales:** You change your pitch slightly for every client.
*   **Evolution:** Genetic mutation is the ultimate variance engine. Most mutations fail (cancer, defects), but the ones that work redefine the species.

## The Necessity of Failure
Variance implies failure. To try something different means you might do something worse. You must accept the "worse" attempts to find the "better" ones.
