### The Debugging Process

Once you’ve answered these questions, you can begin the "Debugging Process":

1.  **Identify the Bug:** What is the specific outcome you want to change? (e.g., "I am always tired.")
2.  **Trace the Incentive:** What rule in your environment is selecting for that outcome? (e.g., "My phone is on my nightstand, and the algorithm is optimized to keep me awake.")
3.  **Propose the Patch:** What is the smallest change you can make to the environment to change the selection pressure? (e.g., "Charge the phone in the kitchen.")

You don't need to be a genius to change the world. You just need to be a designer who knows how to patch the code. 

But there is one final thing you must understand about being a System Designer. The work is never done.
