# The Social Dilemma
**Format:** Documentary (Netflix)

## Core Concept
*   **The Business Model**: "If you're not paying for the product, you are the product."
*   **Algorithmic Manipulation**: Social media platforms are designed to maximize engagement (time on screen) to sell ads.
*   **Unintended Consequences**: This optimization leads to polarization, addiction, and mental health issues, not necessarily because of "evil" intent, but because those are the most efficient ways to keep attention.

## Relevance to the Book
*   **Mechanisms**: Explains *how* the systems do what they do (algorithms, A/B testing).
*   **No Conspiracy Needed**: Reinforces the user's point that there is no "evil cabal"—just a system optimizing for a specific value function (Engagement/Revenue).
