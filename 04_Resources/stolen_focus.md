# Stolen Focus
**Author:** Johann Hari

## Core Concept
*   **The Crisis of Attention**: Modern life, particularly the digital landscape, is systematically destroying our ability to focus.
*   **Systemic vs. Individual**: It's not just a failure of individual willpower; it's an environmental change driven by the "attention economy."

## Relevance to the Book
*   **Consequences**: Illustrates the *consequences* of the selection systems we've built (Social Media/Algorithms).
*   **Environment**: Shows how the environment (constant notifications, infinite scroll) selects for distraction rather than depth.
