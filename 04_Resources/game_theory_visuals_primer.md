**Topic:** Game Theory, Evolution, Population Simulations.

## Relevance to the Book
The channel "Primer" (created by Justin) is an excellent resource for visualizing the concepts discussed in **Chapter 13 (The Payoff Matrix)** and **Chapter 3 (The Adaptation Equation)**.

### Key Videos:
*   **Simulating Natural Selection:** Explains the basic "blob" evolution mechanics.
*   **The Evolution of Altruism:** Directly addresses the Hawk/Dove and Prisoner's Dilemma scenarios using visual simulations.
*   **Rock Paper Scissors:** Explains cyclic dominance (which relates to our "Pendulum" concept).

## Usage in Manuscript
referenced in **Part III, Chapter 15** as a recommended visual guide for understanding how individual interactions create population-level patterns.
