# Manuscript Creation Process

**Status:** Active
**Methodology:** The "Sculptor" Method (Block -> Draft -> Polish)

## 1. The Philosophy
We do not write line-by-line from a blank page. We build structure first, then fill it in. The goal is to capture the author's **conversational voice** (suitable for audiobooks) while maintaining the **rigorous logic** of the framework.

## 2. The Workflow

### Step 1: Blocking (The Skeleton)
*   **Goal:** Define the flow of ideas.
*   **Content:** Bullet points, key questions, specific examples, and the "emotional arc" of the chapter.
*   **AI Role:** Propose the block structure based on the Master Outline and Seeds.

### Step 2: Drafting (The Clay)
*   **Goal:** Get the words down.
*   **Content:** Rough paragraphs. Focus on *rhythm* and *voice*. Use "I" statements. Ask the reader questions.
*   **User Role:** The user writes this part to ensure the voice is authentic.
*   **AI Role:** Can draft specific sections if asked, mimicking the user's style (see `06_Meta/user_style_and_patterns.md`).

### Step 3: Refining (The Polish)
*   **Goal:** Sharpen the argument and fix the pacing.
*   **Content:** Editing for clarity, removing fluff, ensuring the "Hook" and "Bridge" are strong.
*   **AI Role:** Critique the draft using the Personas (`05_Personas/`).

## 3. Style Guide
*   **Voice:** Conversational, humble but confident. "I'm not an expert, but here is what I see."
*   **Tone:** Like a late-night conversation with a smart friend.
*   **Format:** Short paragraphs. Use italics for emphasis. Avoid academic jargon unless defining it immediately.
*   **The "Audiobook Test":** If it sounds weird when read aloud, rewrite it.
