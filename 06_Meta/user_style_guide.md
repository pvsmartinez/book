# User Style Guide & Voice Constraints

## Core Voice Principles
*   **No "AI-style" Punctuation:** Avoid excessive use of em-dashes (`—`) or hyphens to create pauses. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.
*   **Narrative over Lists:** Avoid bullet-point heavy explanations. Use prose and storytelling.
*   **"Earned" Conclusions:** Don't just state "X happened." Explain the mechanism/feeling that led to the result.
*   **Conversational but Polished:** The user speaks in a flow ("insane," "shut dry," "weird"), but the book should be a polished version of that voice.
*   **Empathy:** Understand the "Player" (the reader/human) inside the system. Don't be cold/detached.

## Specific formatting constraints
*   **Lists:** Only use bullet points when strictly necessary (e.g., distinct phases or items). Prefer paragraphs for concepts.
*   **Structure:** Introduction -> Story/Example -> Mechanism -> Synthesis.

## Recurring Directives
*   "Don't be teacher-like."
*   "Don't like repetition."
*   "Feelings should always be earned."
