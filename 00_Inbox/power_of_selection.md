## Core Concept
The user believes a central connecting theme of the book is **"The Power of Selection"** or **"The Power of Iteration."**

*   **Hypothesis:** World systems (biological, social, economic, etc.) function through a process of iteration and selection.
*   **Goal:** Compare different systems and topics to explain this worldview.
*   **Status:** This is currently a "scattered idea" serving as a potential backbone for the book.

## Key Questions to Explore
1.  Is "Selection" the right word? Or is it "Evolution," "Feedback Loops," or "Filtering"?
2.  What specific "world systems" should be compared? (e.g., Evolution vs. Free Market vs. AI Training?)
