# Next Session Notes: The Invisible Hand & The Filter

**Date:** December 26, 2025
**Context:** User is going to sleep, left thoughts on Part III structure.

## Core Idea: The Invisible Hand as a Judge
*   **The Success:** Works great for small-scale competition (price, creativity, differentiation). It drove the rapid evolution of capitalism.
*   **The Failure:** 
    *   **Time Horizon:** Doesn't handle long-term topics well (climate, infrastructure).
    *   **Monopolies:** When one "winner" takes all, the selection pressure for others disappears.
    *   **Negative Externalities:** Areas where the "Judge" (Profit) ignores the cost to the environment or society.
*   **The Question:** Is the "Invisible Hand" still the right judge for the modern world, or has the environment shifted too much?

## Structural Changes to Part III
*   **New Chapter 11: The Invisible Hand.** Deep dive into market selection.
*   **Shift Chapter 12: The Exam Trap.** Move it after the market example to show how "hacking the metric" happens in non-financial systems too.
*   **Shift Chapter 13: The Algorithm's Eye.**
*   **Shift Chapter 14: You Are What You Measure.**
