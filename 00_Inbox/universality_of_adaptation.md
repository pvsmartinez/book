# The Pattern is Everywhere (Universality of Adaptation)

**Source:** User Brainstorming (2026-01-09)

## Core Insight
The Pattern (Iteration * Variance * Selection) is not just biological. It is a mathematical consequence of things adapting. It applies to all scales.

## Examples of the "Runners"
1.  **Micro scale:** Viruses, cells.
2.  **Individual scale:** People learning skills, habits.
3.  **Group scale:** Companies (which exist over time vs those that die), Nations, Societies.
4.  **Non-living:** Ideas (memes), Hobbies (which hobbies survive?), Product categories.
5.  **Cosmic scale (Maybe?):** Planets/Galaxies stability? (Might be a stretch, but interesting thought experiment).

## The Proposal
*   We need to explicitly show this transition from Biology -> Social -> Abstract.
*   "The Arms Race" (current Ch 5) is good for teaching co-adaptation, but might be too specific?
*   We miss a section specifically dedicated to **Organizational/Societal Adaptation**.
*   We need to explain that "uncorrelated stuff" follows the same laws.

## Questions
*   Where does this fit in Part II?
*   Should "Arms Race" be a sub-point or a full chapter?
*   Is Chapter 9 ("Runners and the Track") the place for this overview?
