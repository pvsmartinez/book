# Raw Voice Transcripts

**Purpose:** To preserve the raw, unpolished voice-to-text inputs from the user. This helps in analyzing the author's natural "conversational" writing style (`user_style_and_patterns.md`) and ensures no nuance is lost in the conversion to atomic seeds.

**Instructions:**
*   Append new raw "brain dumps" here chronologically.
*   Do not edit the grammar or structure. Keep the "ums," "likes," and run-on sentences.

## Session 1: Project Setup & Core Theory (2025-12-01)
Hey I want you to set up for me here in this empty folder right now and seed structure for you as an AI to help me create and write a book OK. It will take some time because right now I just have like a ton of ideas about the book itself and so I need your help like to structure first like a lot of scattered knowledge and then probably connecting the dots. And then planning like the order of it all and then probably start writing it. It is probably going to be a small book. It won't be big. And it's a it's a knowledge book. It's it's about some the way I perceive the world and like how everything fits together OK. So first I want you to like search the web for like good patterns to be doing this type of stuff and then. Proposed to me some ideas on how to organize this folder for us.

OK let's do a step number one and I will need your help like doing the folder structure and also like guiding me on how to complete it. So also create like an agents MD file for you to know like in future sessions and how to handle it like every time that I open this VS code copilot here and you know by default like what's the structure and how should help. Me.

First starting dumping the ideas. I want you to create like a git project. For me on my and connect to my PVS Martinez. Gmail OK. Like so that I can have a versioning control from what we're doing here so that I don't lose any work. And also I want you to create some pipelines for me, so some scripts. Shell scripts from like that you can then you yourself will be able to be able to run. Here in my mac so that we update the git. Every session and maybe some appraisal commands and stuff like that and like please add those to me and also like update the agents file as well.

Nice. Now make it so that every time that I open this code and disproge it, you know like all the scripts and through these agents file, right? I'm not sure if agents MD is the correct file for our copilot to read. I think maybe it's something like inside a folder for copilot. Not sure. If you could check for me it would be best OK yeah. Please do that.

Perfect. Now for the appraisal scripts, I want you to create a folder that we should be called like personas or critics or something like that. And that we will have like some typical personas that would be reading the type of book that I'm going to do. And from that that like persona style you will give me like. Evaluation right? So like what this persona would understand and would it dissection be good or not? So like that's one of the things that we should be evaluating, maybe it could be a 2nd type of appraisal like we can we can have this having the script appraisal of like how well written and how big the the document is and like overall style and like some farmer metadata. Evaluation and also another appraisal focusing on like what would this persona hypothetical persona? Be feeling well. Let's create these scripts, maybe some more variations on that. Then I would tell you some personas first to start with the personas, then later we will start with the content

OK. So for the personas you should first think like what's the optimal structure for us to write the personas probably like each persona be its own file, but also like what the file should have, like OK. Probably all files should be MD files right now, like not splint text but. Yeah, rich text like MD. Probably. Right, right. OK and for the Personas. What we should have probably like a name from them and quick like one liner summary of like what what they are so that I can see it quickly when you evaluate and print devaluation for me. And probably stuff like where they live, some form of small biography like what they like or what they what's their age or something like that and like their base knowledge, right, something like that. You could you should probably. Research some papers or some typical persona templates that people use for this type of project and. Yeah, and after you did that, like let's create 5 personas OK. So first. Umm, first we want the. Typical Brazilian businessman working class. Umm is smart graduate umm. Young, probably between like in their 30s. And yeah, and should be someone that's. Probably engineer our tech savvy or something about that around that OK. Then secondly, we should think about some form of like a lawyer. Maybe a bit older, like in the 40s. Desire could be a woman. And thinking more about human rights and more political and so on. Then 3rd we could take a teenager, probably like in the lady, late late teens, so 818 years old, 19 so. The that super engaged and start went to learn about the world and all that but doesn't have much knowledge outside left on Youtube and short time span media and stuff like that. But it is smart like it's engaged just not that usage like. Read this deep looks. Then. We should also have someone from the other audience. Probably a grandpa or someone. Lady 60s, 70s, like, not too old. That could be like. Late in their career, are already not working anymore and could be a bit more conservative. In their point of view, but who has a good heart, right, they have big family. So, so yeah, I think that's also another good perspective for us to add and and yeah, maybe add one more to personalities as well.

Cool, so the first idea that I want to draw is like. What's the center idea of the book? I'm not sure if the center but like one of the things holding everything together OK so. It's the it's about like, umm. The power of selection. Or power of iteration. Are like how world systems like they work so. I want to like. I want to compare a bunch of different systems and topics and from them like try to. Explain the way II, view the world OK so better for me because I'm going to go like I want to say just one single idea here. I would probably say quite a few scattered ideas and then. Yeah, yeah, and help me figure it out like how how to write those up OK. Yeah, I'll probably be always doing this by voice, so text might not be as organized as possible like the inputs that I give you. So if you want to. Address that in your agents MD, our copilot file there so that you know that probably is going to be your job to organize stuff, figure out files and all of that. Because I probably won't know them. I probably just know and like do really hands on writing myself a dance at the end, because by the end I will want to have it written as the way I do usually write, but at the same time. Right now is mostly talking OK, so just bear in mind that. But yeah, yeah, you can also type your like write down how I tend to write. So as we do more and more of these inputs you become more and more similar like you write down more and more similar how I do write down but, but. I kind of write a bit like I'm talking but not right because as you can see, this is clearly a way for someone to say right

Sure, let's go. So one of the things like natural selection, right? So. Let's run selection as ages. Best like ages. Go on people. Like people, the animals, the Biome like it evolves, right? And. Devolution itself is not driven by like 0. This is clearly better, it's just more optimized by the the medium around it. Just so you know I'm Brazilian OK so my main language is Portuguese. I'm doing this in English because I think it's better for AI and also it's good for me to train English so sometimes I won't be saying like the native word. Just just so you know if you want to write down copilot as well. You're learning how I speak and also maybe some of the sentences so you know how to fix them. But yeah, aside from that, going back to the natural selection, let's think of a car concepts here, right, so. The the median like the the uh. Environment around the. Living being. It defines over the time how does that species evolves, right? If it's some place that has a ton of food, then probably like that. Living being won't need to be as efficient with food if it's something that's super low on food. That species will probably, as time evolves, be more right on being efficient. And getting food OK. So that's an example, right? Just a depth one. I'll probably think of a better one noted write it down like I'll think of a better example later, but just some quicker quick dumb example here. So yeah, So what I'm saying here is iteration like we need a lot of. Selection of so breathing mutation, animals, dying animals. New generations coming up a little bit differently and then as as times goes by, like only the the fittest survive. To that environment and and yeah, so that's that's how they evolve OK so so that's one car idea here. There are a ton of things that we can could be done about Metro selection. So we so, so yeah, I'll I'll keep it open right now. But you see as I give more examples and more topics like on stuff that we should be talking about it.

Keep in mind that I always want you to like update several documents not just one at the same time because as I talk about 1 document, maybe this should affect another document, so we should be always like pushing and connecting documents. So I want you to feel free on doing that those OK. Again, update copilot and yeah, and probably most of my inputs here won't like as a because I'm saying. It's not super structured like so in the same input here I can kind of ask you to do more than one thing. OK. So I will need you to multitask here and like touch upon a few different things. So all inputs that I gave you like try to break down into tasks and topics and like things that you should search and cross up for me.

Right now you are just editing like one small file at once and then like doing the sync script like I don't think you need to. You need to do sync like every single time that I do. Any change OK you you can do it like every once in a while. Like every three prompts or something like that? Yeah, like at least like when when we have a few files. Change it together like this need to be like just one commute per line or simply that. I think maybe that's too much OK. And also like just pointing out like you should have some fire somewhere writing down like some meta analysis about how I speak stuff like what are key topics or keywords or key examples that I use all the time. This will help you. And me and to help us later to figure out like how should stuff be written down, like what's their most important examples are like car ideas that center and connect with a lot of other ideas.

Perfect. Love the things that they just written down. It makes sense. So yeah, let's keep going. So. We just talking about natural selection. We'll go dive deeper later that not too late, but yeah, we'll soon talk more about it, but when? Car aspect as well far as you think about here is about machine learning. So. How does AI learn so quickly right because you create like this value functions and then you have this training data and then you run through it and like AI starts from a random out output and then going through this value functions they get evaluated and the more we iterate the better they get into like doing. This like to get better at in getting better and higher values for their own value function OK. So it's again about iteration how many times? It has quite a few components like so iteration, the quality of the value, the quality and like how the learning process happens. Like there are ton of different algorithms and approach and also like algorithms that's a keyword OK. I probably don't want to use the algorithm as the main title or something from like that because I don't want this to be too much like computer science. It's it's more political or more like philosophical about the world. So I don't want the readers to only be from computer science OK but. But yeah, I'll probably have a lot of computer science examples. To give you. So yeah, so machine learning, like it does have like this car concepts here that if you think about it, they have a lot of similarities with natural selection, right, because it's all about iteration, it's about the value function, it's about optimization for. Like in this. In this case like the environment will be the value function, right? So. So mutations like they happen both cases like there are a lot of parallel and similarities here

Nice. I want you to also write down about me, like about the altar OK. So just to know who I am like, and I feel my biases. So I am a computer engineer. From Scala Polytechnica of University of San Paulo. I'm 33 years old. I'm a really creative person. I do. Like great games like since childhood. Bar games and digital games and. I'm quite social, but a bit of an introvert as well. I love mathematics and history, biology and. Yeah, like all the sciences, so. Yeah, and. Not that good in literature, so I will need some help like researching stuff later. But yeah, I love psychology as well, even though I didn't read as much. So yeah, we need some help in that regards because. Ditch upon topics that could be categorized as college, OK and. As my work like like. So do general enterprises and then II entered a startup was I was program programmer then like product designer there. Product Manager. I kind of started there, but then I went to Adlife for a creative games from hackathons. I like this creative person OK. I have a bunch of ideas and like usually what I do is merging ideas. Together to create something new like I think that's kind of what I'm good at. So yes, I've created these games and then II quickly grew the company and started leading some big projects in the company launched one of the biggest games, Disco. Very that. It was quite big worldwide, like nothing. Extra huge, but yeah, good enough. And then I try to create my own startup. To like trying to digitize board games bring. People together and all that. It didn't work out. So like the company, I had to close the company. After a few years trying it. So yeah, like that's more or less the background. I love teaching. I did some volunteer jobs and that not that much, but I did some. And yeah, and I'm happy with the state of the world right now. I'm not a pessimistic. I'm a optimistic person. But at the same time. Yeah, I can see so many stuff going wrong. So, like, one of the purpose of the book here is that I want people to see the world. A bit of how I see it. So like they can try to understand how why some things are going on the way they are going on so that. We as a society can start to think together like what we should be doing.

Nice questions. I do just have. Umm, let's think about those OK, shall we? Don't hate the player. Hate the game. Like that. That's one really good sentence that a lot of people say and like, encompass parts of the the ideas here, right? I think it's implies a bit or like it's not well structured. For people at least the the sentence itself, but it could very well be like that. The the charts the TLDR for this for this book OK. 'cause yeah, yeah, like. This book will merge like. Algorithms. Natural selection and like systems and how those shape. Politics, how those shape economics, how those shape over time like time is one of the car aspects of iteration and. A lot of people don't figure that out right? People say, oh, something worked in the past or like 0. How low these past 10 years were good? Like clearly we should still doing this or that and people don't understand how like. Choices compounds over time, right as. Time goes by like. Things I wouldn't say go get more extreme, but they get more optimized for whatever it is, the value function, the algorithm, the. Incentives for. The current process like what's the algorithm? Right. So like that's always happening through time. OK. So like oh, we love capitalism OK. But yeah, but capitalism over time will make revenue more. Merit concentrate. I'm not sure how to say that in English. So yeah, like over time, right. And and and like, one thing that people don't get also about capitalism is like. Capitalism tries to do this exponential curve of money concentration in the hands of a few. But this exponential curve. It depends on how many people you have. You can have a more extreme version. Like a small group. Has so much richness, like it's limited the amount of richness that they have. So the richest person can't be that rich or that richer than the rest. And as you grow in amount of people. The amount of. Richness, I don't that's not the correct term. Uh, gross. So the exponential curve, like it's kind of the same, but it gets more extreme in the sense that the amount of power that one person gets gets bigger and bigger.

No, no politics. I don't want to talk about corruption like we could, but I don't think we need to. Umm, I think what's bigger and pressing matter that probably more interesting to talk about politics. Just find out like probably I will be talking about politics later in the book because. Maybe hinting at it at first, but I think it's good to have the lens for the politics after we have like the framework. But to be discussing about it, if you want to have like a resource II, love the book Wide Nations Fails. Well, I probably mentioned this book quite a few times. In my own just because II. Love how they create this view. Of how the world works. So yeah, so I would love to try to do something similar in the sense of. Trying to create a lens and then as we go deeper into chapters and stuff like that, we should like discussing a lot about each of the components of this framework that we've built. And probably politics would be an example, right? So probably not the first thing on the book OK at least an idea right now, not, not, not super sure, but going back from politics itself, like what I think it's more interesting to talk about. Let's talk about marketing, democracies, voting and time, right? Because let's think about it. Every person has one vote, so. Umm, the value function is quite clear here, right? You need votes to stay in power. From one point of view you would say that we have like people who doesn't don't care about staying in power forever. Or staying in power too much because like they just want to do like their parts and then leave like there are people like that, but. Let's be real, like a lot of people love when they love something, when when they start doing something, they tend to use this type of thing forever because like that, that's who they are. Like they're it's hard for people to transition, right? So if they are politicians for a lot, for some time, it's hard, it's it becomes harder for them to change because that's in their curriculum. That's what they know about like their social networks. Around that. And as they do it, they get better at it and then figure out more stuff that you can do it right. So whenever people start something, they. Tend to stay on like I wouldn't say they don't pivot and on change areas, but it's harder for like a doctor to then become a lawyer, right. Then yeah, you could say like a doctor start like doing business on medicine or like so. So it's a pivot and a changing career, but not, not like the biggest change ever, right. So the same thing for politics like it's usually harder, right. So OK, so thinking about that. You have to think about like OK so hundred. S and thousands of people every year try to enter politics. They. Grow in politics, right? So you have this random assessment of people just. As we talking about random algorithms or random natural sections, right? So random assessments of people with different purposes trying to do stuff, people who are good at communication, communicating who people who are. More introverts. Extroverts good at relationships, know the names of everyone, remember stuff. They have good memories. People who are good about explaining stuff and and so and so on, right? And so far, so you have like all these different behaviors. Sorry, I just got it here. And then. And then, yeah, like who? Who? Who wins, right? Who? Who becomes the president? Or who stays in the Senate forever? Or like who? Who points out to the judge and stuff like that like. It varies by country, right? But in the the profile of politicians that come up, they usually have something in common, right? And. That's usually based on the value function from politics, right? So it's based on like how they get votes are like how they grew their own social network to be more more influential. And have more and more power so that they can keep doing what they are doing be. A center for like forever in Brazil. Are trying to become a president and bring our own agenda. So, yeah, so and so like how we do it then, right. And when you think about politics, like it's a medium that change it a lot in the past few years because of the Internet and yeah, yeah, like that. That's something that we're talking about a lot. Like the Internet how things change it and so on. I'll let you write down stuff and I keep going on this topics.

On the books side, like also write down, umm, stolen focus. It's a good book as well. Umm, it talks like a pressing matter for current day and age. So like one of the it's more about the consequences of what the social media landscape has done. So it's probably good. Later I would like to try to talk about like the consequences of the algorithms that we the systems that we create around the world. More than about. How the systems do that, like about how the systems do that we could do is the documentary like The Social Dilemma. It's a good documentary and talking about like what Facebook and all the social medias they are doing and also we we probably like 1 other topic here for us. So yeah like. Social media and like their attention economy like all of that. Like why do? Those companies do what they are doing. Like, are they evil? Is there, is there a conspiracy here? Like, no, they're not like. Every system people can coordinate, definitely. But in the end, people, individuals are like anything like that. Like it's always it's on. Person on its own minds trying to do its own thing. Uh. So it has its own range of ideas and tests and of that and then the system. Filters what works OK so if. The Internet. Has grew from the idea of free. Sharing. For everyone like this, this idea is super nice, right? It's it's kind of topic, right? Let's let's give knowledge for everyone, for free. Let's give services for everyone, like the Internet for everyone. It's super beautiful. I did believe in that. But we have to think about consequences and that's when cara specs here as well. Consequences. Everything has consequences. Like everything that we are doing has always shaped up environment OK. So. If the Internet is free by default and if the Internet is the first thing, then connect billions of people so. If in the past it was slow to get information across and geography mattered a lot in terms of a lot of things. From knowledge, media, communications and so forth. Like the Internet is the first thing that has so much people. And it's free. But like, how it's free? Like it's not free, right? So it has to be paid by something 'cause. Staff costs should be made and we live in a world that you need money to do stuff and you also want money like that. That's one of the incentives for people to create the companies in the 1st place, right? So. So yeah, like when when you fit together a few components and Oh yeah, that's also a good thing, components here. So when you're thinking about systems, you have to think about different. Components are like half different. Aspects of the environment, how they match, and depending on how they match, emergent behavior appears emergent behavior. That's a good term. As well, so yeah. Free service for billions of people. Connecting everyone but it costs and people want to get money. How would you do it right? Umm, you can do it either one. By selling engagement, selling. Advertisement like for people are. Secondly, you can. Get a **** ton of money from few people to pay for everyone. So when talk about whales in games are. Whales are like high spenders OK. So when we talk about like someone spending. **** ton of money gambling like, oh, it's super sad. That's a person spent it. But at the same time this one person that spent $1000. They helped the operations for the developers to create this product for the other 900 people. Their app, right. So you either get revenue from everyone because that's from engagement. Or you get a **** ton of money from some people and for you to get a ton of money from some people you you need to go to addiction, to gambling. You are statuses right? So from fashion and and like some form status, yes social. Recognition, right? So yeah, so quite a few ideas here for you to write down

Let's define a bit more about the way you select. That's not a concept that most people know about or like. They don't think much. So yeah, so. Like one thing that I saw quite a lot like. Let's talk about gaming. So yeah, gaming. It's free. Let's play Fortnite. Everyone can play it, right? So super casual, super easy for everyone. And yeah, I like what could go wrong. A lot. You have ton of people and you need to make money for you to develop like the schemes and develop the content and and release the game for people, right. So. You have to monetize somehow and you don't want to be right, so you need to to do skins. But Patriot could work as well like. What's the percentage of people that you think that pay? For a game like. Spanish super low, right. You're talking about 10%, 1% of users that convert like the other 99%, 90%? They never pay anything like from this one percent of payers. One to 10% of players like one to 10% of dan would be high spenders or Wales, right so. And like this one percent of the whales, like 1% of the 1% of the whales, like they are super whales that spend thousands of of dollars and some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if I'm not mistaken there was there are few games that achieved millions of dollars from single player. And like, this can be like unimaginable. Like, holy **** how could someone do that? Like, don't add holy **** in that book, please. You can write down that I said it, but no. No forbidden words please in in the book itself, but yeah. So imagine this, right? It is 1% of the 1% of people. They spend so much. And when you do the end like when you do the averages, right, because games need to reach people and to reach people they do ads. And to do ads they have to market themselves and to market themselves. Like you have the cost to show for people, so like. With all this math, you could have like an average of spending like $1, 1 1/2 dollars per per dollar, $2 per download, and you need to earn like $3 for dollars per dollar. Probably more, right? The rules return of investments should be positive, but yeah, don't need to be super technical here. Remember, like a lot of people here are not from tech, are not for economics and that, but yeah, but we we need to explain enough, right? So yeah, so like we have this really small percentage of people that then they're paying and like how is that possible, right. So first you need to do again. That has deep content and you can can't be spent a lot on. So gotcha is a good example, but you could have like the Super pricey skins you can have like temporary. Currency or something that's consumable? So like it's kind of our games that like more games for you to like spend on troops and then when two players fight between each other, like they kill each other's troops. So they are like essentially killing burning money from non player against the other. Yeah, that's essentially what they're doing and they're doing that for status for like showing off for their own goods. So like the game designer, the game designer, which is usually a system designer, they need to create incentives, they need to create the rules. Like so what's the objective? What are the key factors like what what the levers like the the player can use? To try to go through that game and be the best, right? Umm, so yeah, like a system, a system designer, a game developer, in essence, in the multiplayer game or in a game like, they're creating their own system, like their own environment, natural section and so far, right. So yeah. So you can have these high speeders. Try to do that. Are being on top of fashion and be the best players there, right? So that's also. A good example. So yeah ton of ways for us to either spend a lot of for you to play forever right so the the game need need also to bring your attention span as much as possible so like. Let's do Sunday requests and and so far, right, so the type of games that appear on mobile versus the types of games that appear on PC. Different. And they are super different exactly because of the key incentives on each platform, right? It's not the developers are evil or anything like that, it's just that. It's harder for you to create in mobile a game. That won't be. That much suited and optimize it into deep meta games and play progressions. Because if you do a game like that, you probably won't earn as much money per user, and if you don't earn as much money per user you won't be able to market. And if you want to pay be able to market you won't be able to grow. And if you are not able to grow, you are not able to pay your employees. So you're. Her not be able to create your own game. So like it the as you do it the more of a gamble it is so it's harder right. So yeah so like there's a type of game that can be done in in mobile landscape and. See landscape like. It slowly churned changing, right? But at the same time, like, we have like all of those forces of people trying to do stuff. This is not about evil. It's just like about odds. Like, would you do something trying to fail? Just because. You love it like in Mar, and you think the rest is wrong. And even if you fail, at least you did the right thing like. And a lot of people would, and these are beautiful words, but not it's not black and white like. We could go deeper into like, oh, you're OK with doing it. We're not OK with doing gambling, but you like it. Magic the Gathering, which you opened Busters and maybe get a rare sticker. So is that gambling? And then oh no, no. Magic the Gathering is like, too much. Of a gambling game OK. So then what then? You only have to pay for. Exactly knowing what you are going to get, like, that's the car thing here. Or you have to pay only before you play something like you can't release a DLC because OK. If you don't accept gotcha, then I'll give you a DLC right? It's another way. So yeah, there's there's always something for you to hate

Yeah, time. Let's talk about time. Uh. I think one of the best ways for us to find time is like the easiest ones would be with. Umm. Money, money and compound interest. And investments like. Say we've created a system. That if you have. Sitting money. So you have extra money, right? And if you've you invested it. In the Treasury OK. So. In Brazil right now as 2025 our. Silk rate. No, no Silic. SELIC. Yeah, yeah, that's right. So the silic rate OK, you cannot translate it in real time, but it you will figure out once you read the input. So this rate is about like the compound rate, uh it's interest rate country, it's right now it's 15% OK which is huge like. Let's just think about it, say. I have 100K dollars. City still. By Dandoff next year, I will be 115. And I won't have done anything. Write a joke. This money just appeared. Out of lower. Imagine like the working class in Brazil, like the minimum wage is like. 1K, 1K and a half, something like that. I talk in Brazilian hairs, but I like the numbers don't really matter. I probably should write down the correct numbers. Because of accuracy and for the book, kind of that. Like people, definitely. Complain. People love to cherry pick bad examples to complain and disregard your arguments. So yes, be correct the numbers. And later you can search it or you can search it now right correct numbers as. As of right now. November, December 2025. So yes, like in one year by doing nothing this. Richer person. It's not super richer richer person that had 100K and doing nothing. It generated more money than someone that worked the whole year. And by doing nothing right. And let's say that like they doesn't, they don't need that money. That year, right. If they don't need that money that year, so next year will be A115 that would compound so. Yeah, on my head would be hard to do this math, but it's probably A135 or something like that. That would be by the end of the year. You could check the math. And and do the math for me like in 5 years. In five years, like it would be so much money that every money every year actually. That person would be doing. The money worth of like three people from the minimum wage. So like it started as one person and then became three people, and. And yeah, and and this gets worse over time. OK. So, so it's quite obvious here. Like it's crystal clear right now here, right. This single system that was designed by someone. About. Interest rates and lending money. It has one consequence. That richer people. We'll get richer faster than poorer people like by default OK. I'm now talking about these other consequences. Look like there are other consequences like. This is a good way for people who were poorer to get richer and like investments. In part it has a lot of **** OK, but I'm focusing on this one and II want the book to always talk about things having more consequences, like. I'm not talking about evil or good. I'm talking about systems and consequences. Like what are the levers? That define the value function for our system OK. And. So so something that. At the beginning you designed it was working. Maybe in ten years or 20 years or 50 years the error from the system that you created. It will compound. And as it compounds like, it becomes clearer and clearer like. How? Impossible. That is right. Because like this minimum wage person and this person who was doing nothing like in a few in a few years time, like they would be so far apart that like one person will be like getting more money than 10, 2015 people by doing nothing right. And and just because of time, just because time passes right 'cause they want the person who had the minimum wage never got the chance to start. Stocking money. And since they didn't do it, they just are far and because now. A lot of years. Have already compounded. It's kind of. It's Passover dueling. It's no longer. And it's no longer feasible. Like it won't matter for them to just start. Getting money after 100 years because like, the differences between who has too much and who has too little, like would be so big then. Then yeah, it would be, wouldn't be relevant, right. So at some point. Like maybe in 500 years times from now. If capitalism is the same, probably like compounding money won't matter. Like the the poor person won't matter at all if they start. Trying to get money because yeah, there will be too, too much fun behind, right. So it completely impossible if the environment doesn't change, which something that's also important and we will note it probably natural selection and maybe similar places about how, yeah. If the environment was always the same, we would have like the Super strong optimized stuff for like this environment, but. The truth is that environment changes as well, because as stuff evolve, they also change back the environment. So it's there's a feedback loop loop there, right? And the environment changes a bit. So like what's the value change, the value function also changes.

I want to give more ideas right now so we can get deeper and stronger here. We won't need to add everything to the book, right? So probably having more is better than having less. And so I went to add about again about the iteration. The power of iteration itself like. And we can talk about viruses and covet, like that's all good example for people because super recent and people, people remember what happened, right? So talking about like the mutations. We don't need to go deep into this, right? We can just. Quickly gloss over, right. I'm talking about like, oh, people remember like OK. So one of the car, one of the key things is that it was a disease that wasn't little like easily little like the percentage of vitality was not that high, but the, the percentage of. Contagio not sure. Not sure how to say that in in English like the the the. Rated pass front person to another like it's. I don't remember that there was a specific keyword for that. It's super high, so. And it. Takes a long time for people to diagnose and perceive that they are already transmitting. So like if you think about it like, it has the car components for an epidemic. An epidemic is like the value function for a virus, right? Because the virus which is also already like AA debate if it's living thing or not. But in the end like even if it's not a living thing, even if it's not a living thing, that's also a fun thing to say non living things also. Work by. The system's power. That's something cool to talk about it just to drive people, because people talk about like, oh, there's like this conspiracy theory and all of that. Or the minds of people like the no, no, this. The power of iteration is so strong that even things that does not have conscience or are not living they also. Follow this rule. OK we need to figure out the name of it and like what's the concept? Viruses. Then they they want to spread as much as possible and. Covid had. The Kerfings and then people started vaccinating and doing and quarantine and all of that, and it became harder for Covid and then Covid, but people didn't need like 100 percent and because of that I didn't que the Furious completely eradicated. So what happened? Most of the viruses just just ventured, but the few which did it. They reproduce it and the virus mutated and become became even more contagious, right? Not that, and it was super visible quickly. How quickly it would evolve it right. And it did evolve because of the iterations. Like it's iterations power. You could like just gloss over like the same thing about insects and like poison. Like toxic. Like you, you, you, you do like this. Spray to cure insects and like this brain needs to change every decade or so. You probably should research that 'cause I might be wrong here, but I think it's that good or 20 years or so. But I owed poison doesn't kill insects because they cured their. Generations of ancestors so like the ones that survive it, like they doesn't, they don't die anymore from that, right 'cause so it's super quick iterations like. They they they have the power of rotating stuff. And if you think about it. Iteration. It's all about time. It's just that if you do fast iterations you have have a huge amount and if you have a higher mutation degree then maybe you need less time. So like it's it's awesome form of equation here, right? Time against iterations against mutation rates. Like what's the? Learning curve. To adapt to this value function, right? That's the curving here. So it applies to COVID, it applies to viruses, it applies to insects. Yeah it it can apply as to police and robbers to rock hackers and anti hackers like this cat and mouse you can talk about that in natural selection about. Predators and prey running on Safari like typical example for natural selection here. And yeah, yeah, like and this is natural selection one like you can also talk about like how the animals over the time. Godfather. And faster and faster because like, that was the coffee here, right? Or they got bigger and bigger during the dinosaurs and then after some reset, like getting bigger was not what matter anymore, but like being stealthier and being group play right, group play **** bigger animals.

I think it will be interesting to talk about umm like this non living stuff. We can't we can talk about like how ideas is spread and like. What an idea. Be a living thing, right? No, it's it's not living thing. So why does it spread, right? So it's quite similar. So that's something power right here that's just like how it directs. It just works like just happens, right? So yeah, I think that's. That would be also good thing for us too. Elaborate as well. Yeah, education could be also a good example, so. Let's talk about education and. How time progress, right? Let's think about schools. At first. Teachers will teach. Students. In several different ways. Like there 'cause there are teachers that are more. Market driven. More citizen driven, citizenship driven, right there. There could be a lot of different ways, right, so. At first you have schools that are more folks than on universities and passing exams more. For the rich, for the poor, for the real smart, for, for being inclusive, for being sparse driven and all, and so on and so on, right? So you have this random sample. And then. As each year pass you have students that go to University A or that go to University B. And parents? That are worried about their. Son. Future might prefer a school that delivers. They stood it. Trabajar diversity, like overall, right? Have better odds. So what happens then? Which school would have a better arts? The school that teaches more the subjects that will. Go in the excel are. The school that teaches more about life and about how to be a better human being or how to understand your own self better or. Or like even how to be the best? Employees ever or however, right? This school that teaches better how to pass in an exam in the long run will probably. Have better students. And be more competent to enter and will be able to. Kosmar like higher prices, like higher higher values so more more schools will see those debt and will try to do that as well and. The long run? As years goes by, every school. Will be doing this right? They will be all trying to be the best in the exams possible, right? So. What defines what a school teaches? Is the subject of the exam. And the subject of the exam is just. Some random thing that the university decided that would be important for. To be able like to OK like those people are acceptable, then the government changes it, right? And changes it and like try to create this so so define it out all schools. Because of that, right? So it's not about citizenship and teaching students something that will be useful in their lives, but not in the immediate term. So let's say. How to be better in handling your own economics? Finances, finances, right so. Like 100 percent of the people would be better off by learning financial control. But school? Schools, they don't teach it right and why they don't teach it because it's not in the exams. So it's not about left or right views of politics or anything like that. Is just about. The value function right? So and over time schools get fitted. Into this evaluation just point out that also like. As every school. Becomes exam driven. Not being exam driven becomes a differential as well. So you have this emergent behavior of, this emergent value function behavior of like desirability of being the. The only one that teaches. About civil rights or about financial? Control, personal financial control, right. So it's clear. And that's because become like not something that randomly appears, but strategically, some elite schools. Would differentiate themselves, so. Like poorer schools? Like more social schools. Definitely won't teach those things, but. Richard. Will, and sorry for the long input here, but just so that we can keep going the chain of thoughts probably should write down a ton of stuff here. Because every. Thing has consequences. OK. So a system. Has an environment that defines a value function that iterations changes the players, and as the players change, the value function itself changes because there are consequences and as there are consequences. Environment changes and everything like keeps looping like that over time and the error compounds OK so going back like so we just talking about how most schools. Become about passing universities. And some rich schools. They differentiate themselves. About teaching civil rights and stuff that wouldn't be a. Devaluation. Then what will you you you get is that you start getting. These left centered. People that are rich. The caviar rich people, as here in Brazil, people say like the. They are rich, but they are left centered and they are thinking about human rights and all of that because they learned that from school, right? Because their school. Becomes, as time passes, more left centered right. So you you create this political bias. I eat this part of the population. Because like all the other, like the the poorer. Ones don't get these learnings in school, so. It's not that everyone's left centered like it's more than the rich ones become like this. Type of people and as these people value education and get left centered, they might enter. Politics and after a few decades, change the exams so that the exams themselves become more left centered. But then you have to think, oh, if the exams now have topics that are in another direction. What's the consequences?

I probably should change, but I just had. I said to like, it's bad to have more examples than less and then we'll probably future as we go. But just all the ideas just thought about like. Fake news. Like probably could just talk about like fake news and how they spread and like they are. No not they are not living right so. Some some examples about the algorithms of social media. Could be good here. Just to explain why figliuos would grow or like some type of leos, grow more than others, like about anger and all that. Mentioned in the last Focus book as an example. Another way example that we couldn't live is like this story of Youtube. I think it's a good example because it's super simple. At first Youtube was would recommend. Videos based on. Number of views. So what we would see is this super short videos like 10 seconds long, five seconds long that will be like the the memes, the memes right they so. The squirrel looking back at you like 0, that's a lot of that stuff, right? And then. Early days of the Internet. so. They saw it like they changed it. It so that would be watch time. They wanted to change like the content, so they tried to recommend based on how much. Availability totally viewed like that would prank the videos and that would suggest. Videos for people. So what happens is that those short videos, they venture and then Youtube started having this really long videos and which type of channel? Screw the the type of channels that would be Let's Play. Right, because for you to record yourself, play our community stuff. Is way quicker than you like doing like say news Youtube channel. 'cause our animation show because like the amount of work per minute displayed is way higher. I'm not saying that let's plays are better, I'm just saying that I'm out of work per minute is higher. Like usually let's play cello outputs way more minutes. Of video. Than any other type of channel. OK just as podcasts have grew as well like the same the same sense OK so so it was watch time and I'll turn off channels died because of that and a turn off like and this Let's Play community appeared and and super fun because like Let's Play appeared at the same time as Minecraft and Minecraft was like the best game so let's play at the moment so it grew organically in a time that marketing was. Almost free in the Internet because way less people were doing it, so it was possible for this phenomenal phenomenon to appear. So so yeah, like you change it gaming forever, this let's play and it was done by like an algorithm in Youtube. So it's random consequence. And then they saw it and like Youtube tried to change the other team again because it was basically becoming gaming platform and they didn't want that. So like how to change it and the algorithm for you to change it a lot. Like it became more and more complex and. Interested people should take a look because super interesting, like every era of Youtube did break different types of content. Any kind of crystal clear of like what type of content appeared so you can kind of imagine like what the charts and rios from Tiktok and Youtube. Are changing the content itself that appears, but we don't need to go that. I prefer to talk about the early days of Youtube.

Before talking about solutions, I think we should converge. Right, so. Can you list for me like all the concepts? That I've written so far. Probably you should read again on the pages.

I want to build a framework so. Those dots kind of connect, but it's not obvious how they connect OK. I want to try to connect those all of them OK. So like how iteration and time and consequences and evolution and mutation. Like how they are synergize like like mathematics like can we do an equation or some form of framework that can be visually seen or easily explained in some sentences like the Cartesis here like. Be like the. The violations, failures, simple extractive versus. Inclusive and so on, right? So yeah, like. How can we synthesize like everything that we just said and so just so that you know like what, what are the solutions direction? I'm not trying to solve any of the points that that's one of the car ideas of having a lot of topics is that I'm not trying to explain and solve one of them. I want people. To have the correct mind set about how to go solving. Them and that's probably why. The more examples the better. And probably I will have more examples because. It will be good to give more and more and more examples like how changes and things effects each other OK so, so probably we'll have more future but just going back like. The solution? For like. Not telling a lot of things, like how they went wrong, like I'm just telling how things went the way they went. And why people? Complain like about those like they didn't appear from out of nowhere. It's not that things went wrong, we could do like examples. From things going well as well, right? So we can say why capitalism move on over. Socialism. During the last century, right? We can talk about like, how. Having incentives to create your own. Umm your ideas and sharing them and like trying to. Creature and entrepreneurship. Like, which is one of the car things from Why Nation's Fair right? We can like quickly quote them, right? So. By having a more inclusive system that would allow you to create your own II idea, share it and profit from it like this would make people try to bring umm technology and development and so forth. And because of that, in the long run it would start growing right while. Social socialism doesn't have like this incentive. When it's, think about the value. Preposition. The thing is that's super hard for the topic communism to work. So socialism with the. Real communism, right, is the feasible one in the sense that someone needs to govern still, right? If the someone's needs to govern, there is some power hierarchy, and if there's some power hierarchy, there's some value function going on here. That is not money because it's not capitalism so. It's power. And if it's power, not money, it's influence. And if it's influence, it's about who knows and what favor you want all to each other and. And so forth. II. Probably need to research more to talk about socialism, but just talk about it like just Spire this out and. Keep a note about studying more. In the future so that I can explain better. The Soviet Union, right? Yeah, I think that's a good example and that's also a good example over time. So like capitalism won against socialism for the same reason that nowadays people don't hate capitalism because of. Compounds air. OK so. At the beginning, entrepreneurship. Would be all about. Having an idea trying it out. Selling to people as. Smart people did that. We started having bigger investors. That would give money fire to create your own idea because investors wanted to join these entrepreneurs, right? The investor is someone who's already has the money, right? And they want to join the fund. Like they don't have the idea, they don't have the creativity or the. Time to put into this new stuff and this new risk. But they have money so they they want to join the risk and it can be for can be just for profit but it can also be for a good reason like they do when they want to do good to the world. So investors are not bad people even though some people think about it. But if you. Think up and even though I said about like compound rates and stuff like that, like it's not bad OK. That's something that I want people to think about it. But as we have more investors. Doing the entrepreneurships, we start having venture capitals. And engine investors and of that? And as you'll start having. Engine investors and venture captives. You start having entrepreneurs that don't don't need to have profits. Since the beginning. So if in the past century, like companies, we need to be have profits super early, like the past few decades, that was no longer the case. Because they can grow by burn money, burning money, right? And if they are growing, more investors want to join this company, so you get even more investors, so has have even less desire. On having profit and if you have even less desire, you start growing even more. And then suddenly profits no longer. Something that matters. And investor investments become like. An end in itself is no longer the mean, because if you invest, someone will later invest and buy what you invested, so you earn money about it. And if talking about parameter schemes, it looks like it because someone's always buying what the other one sold, so it doesn't matter. The profit it matters the. Promise of a future profit or the amount of size that you are. So what start happening is that. The entrepreneurs that really grow? Maybe not. The best ones in making money, but they're probably the best ones about convincing. And investors and venture captives. So it's another type of entrepreneur that's more marketing oriented just. As the politicians that we just said, right, so you can see like the, the. And then as that happens, investors like there's so many investors and so much money being poured into new ideas. What's happening is like you have start getting the concentration of investments. As a by product. Of this, all of this, right? So you start having fewer companies getting bigger and bigger and bigger seeds and precedes because venture capitals like they need even more money because they don't need profits. Like just by having money you can burn it and it can have the promise so that if if you can raise more money than the other. You're more likely to get even more money after because it's. Like people want to even more right 'cause the promise will get even bigger because like it's kind of self self appealing prophecy. Because reality doesn't matter anymore. Like in terms of like current results. What matters like the is that you raise it so much money and you have so much promise that just because you have so much promise and raise that so much money, you probably should raise more and. Who doesn't want to be on the the place that everyone is investing, right? So start creating this bubble of investments and that's probably right where we are right now with the Magnificent 7. And the big tax and bubble of AI and all that. So, yeah, so it's funny, right? Because that's just compounding effects of entrepreneurship and investments and capitalism of the centers, right?

*User:* "Is there a way for us to have like the raw inputs that I gave you? Like log it somewhere? Maybe a script that gets this chat history and compounds it like in some form of document. Just we we can run it from time to time just because later we could review like what I said and what we write written down. I think what it is written down is all correct, but I think it might be good to have like the. Ryan puts themselves so that we can like later try to like start telling kind of similar on the way of that I write."

## Session 2: Solutions & System Design Mindset (2025-12-02)
OK, I think we can talk a bit about solutions. So solutions, they're not solutions. OK umm, I mean it's more about once you are aware than like. How these systems evolve? Over time. Then you should start thinking just like. A system designer and that's probably when like. Game game theory and like things that are teached in game design universities will be most useful here, right? And probably we should do some research and some anecdotes of like. System designs and features changes. From game designers and like how those fixed. Issues. That the games we're having so like the car behavioring behavior here. Is that whenever a game is not? Working the way it was intended so like say have too many toxic players or engagement is low or. Users are exploiting. A system wherever like the problem is like the designer. It doesn't. Complaints against users like they don't fight against that user. If they start fighting, they will lose, right? And it will be kind of useless whatever they do. A designer, they what they do is they change the rules. They do balance patches. Umm, they change features? They add new features? So they change stuff, right? And that's the car mentality, like that's how. You. Change the environment. Enable iterations and enable variations. So that the output the outcome is the one that you desired, right? So just as. Dog breeding are like pets breeding. It's something that humans choose to like. Find the. The races they were after, like the the have the attributes that they were after. It's the system designer. It's just like that. But it changes the system itself. Right. Let's see a game. I need to do research here for example. But there are games that like they did balance patch like 10 times in the same character trying to like nerve it speed or it's rain for anything like that and then it just. Doesn't matter. That character still was OP like, overpowered. So it still stayed the same right as to was broken so. It was not about editing it, but maybe like after they added some characters that would. Be strong against it or like they change it. Defense mechanic Daniel Perry is the way A or B. So then, like the player itself, change it. I probably should research some Mmos examples as well. From stuff that brought inflation or made users play too much against one type of bus or stop, like doing some. Strategies that were not fun, like I definitely need to research, but that that's the way to go right for me would be giving examples of gaming. And probably teaching life services and how. To do these systems architectures to change behaviors and giving examples of stuff that. Designers try to change and then didn't change anything because they didn't actually. Change the value function. And at the same time. Examples that were successful and like how to enter this mindset of the designer itself

## Session 3: Security, Favelas & The Need for Both Solutions (2025-12-02)
Nice. One other topic that we should talk about is about. Security. The fight against it in Brazil. It will probably need some context for the international viewers, but it's it's super interesting because it's something that's evolving over time and that's always a debate and no clear solution. But it can definitely be seen. In the objects of the framework that we just did OK so. Well, let's start with like OK. So the favelas, right the, the. Excluded from society place where a lot of poor people come together to. Build the Super cheap housing with no infrastructure? No. No sewage, no like, basic needs and stuff like that. So, like, it's close to the city because that's where jobs are, that's why. Favelas appeared like they are never the bit of the feud, like they are usually big. Urban cities like where? Jobs and opportunities exist, right? So people travel there. They don't find good opportunities. They need to go to the suburbs then. Are so badly planned and so badly created, and the favelas appear. And as. There is no opportunity. It is cheaper and easier for you to earn money. And selling stuff. Or silly. And that's because no one else is willing to do those. So there's no competition and any market that doesn't have competition, it's easier to grow like. Basic capitalism, right? So. You have illicit drugs. And you have stilly. And then imagine if you are a child growing. There, right. It's hard for you to study. It's hard for you to be included in society. It's harder for you to everything like. Cardiff rich community commutes not to be rabbit and and so on and so forth and like. It's easier for you too. Earn money. By other means, right? By stealing or helping like selling drugs and so forth, right so. So. You agree that like? You may. Lock up in prison some drug dealer, but then anyone will appear because you just removed competition. So. So yeah, and and over time. This so so but but at the same time if you don't like, you could say that if locking people in prison like arresting people would be like fighting against the symptom, right? Oh, because the since the system is the same. Just the next drug dealer will appear and will be always like that, but at the same time. When you like fighting the system has it uses because it helps progress. Of the time compounding effect. So 'cause if you don't fight the system. You could say that the king. Drugs would be so profitable. That the person who sold drugs don't want to sell anymore. And because like, they want to do the cool stuff and they are afraid of being caught. By the police. So they start trying to. Clean their money. By buying some legal businesses that could be in the Gray area are finding some other way to like cleaning their own money. And once they've cleaned their own money, like they wouldn't stop. The attachments with the drug dealing so they they will still. On that. But at the same time now they are doing the clean stuff, so they are growing the clean stuff and they are probably better. Than the ones that only do the clean stuff because they are. Able to do the clean stuff and The Dirty work as well, because like they sold drugs and did. Robbery and violence before. So why don't they keep doing that? And that's how like mafias are born, right? Mafia's are. Like the gangs and like they're just different names for the same thing, right? You have now this groups that have a lot of legal stuff, so it's harder. Kind of impossible for you right now to, like, arrest everyone because they. As time goes by, they get more money and more influence and then they probably want to get into politics so that they can protect themselves by having good, good connections. And so now they do like everything right from the legal stuff to the illegal stuff. And they are like really big and a big problem that will probably. Exist for generations and super hard to to remember right so. But it if they never reach that point then probably would be harder for them to reach if you hop down. Their progress. So working with the symptoms is never the solution because it's will be A never ending problem but it can buy you time so. That's kind of more or less like why you need to do both, right? You need to figure out like how you change the system so that's not more lucrative for you to sell drugs than to go to school. As a kid. In the favela. And at the same time you need to like selling drugs. Selling drugs, it's just stop, right? So. So yeah, you can say the same for for for A game, right. So. If if hacking a game is the only way for you to win, like you need to stop the hackers. But everyone who fights against knows that like hackers will hack, right? So you, you. You won't win, I guess that, but it's super hard. It may be easier. Like you can't do it because like we would, we can say that computer science. Is more protectable than like the real world cause control more of the variables, but at the same time it's a good proxy, right? It's hard for you to fix hacking, So what you do, you try to create different incentives like. It's not that great for you to hack any more. So like a solution for not getting parted from some games in Brazil was just like let's lower the prices and. By lowering the prices, the hackers stop it, right? Or like you have so many stories about like that. Like you didn't. Fights the hacking community, but you kind of OK. You hack, but you hack discontrolled. Way. Right. And you have to do like both, right? You have to do. The systemic solution and the. More immediate one because long term and short term needs to be work together.
