# Raw Voice Transcripts

**Purpose:** To preserve the raw, unpolished voice-to-text inputs from the user. This helps in analyzing the author's natural "conversational" writing style (`user_style_and_patterns.md`) and ensures no nuance is lost in the conversion to atomic seeds.

**Instructions:**
*   Append new raw "brain dumps" here chronologically.
*   Do not edit the grammar or structure. Keep the "ums," "likes," and run-on sentences.

## Session 1: Project Setup & Core Theory (2025-12-01)
Hey I want you to set up for me here in this empty folder right now and seed structure for you as an AI to help me create and write a book OK. It will take some time because right now I just have like a ton of ideas about the book itself and so I need your help like to structure first like a lot of scattered knowledge and then probably connecting the dots. And then planning like the order of it all and then probably start writing it. It is probably going to be a small book. It won't be big. And it's a it's a knowledge book. It's it's about some the way I perceive the world and like how everything fits together OK. So first I want you to like search the web for like good patterns to be doing this type of stuff and then. Proposed to me some ideas on how to organize this folder for us.

OK let's do a step number one and I will need your help like doing the folder structure and also like guiding me on how to complete it. So also create like an agents MD file for you to know like in future sessions and how to handle it like every time that I open this VS code copilot here and you know by default like what's the structure and how should help. Me.

First starting dumping the ideas. I want you to create like a git project. For me on my and connect to my PVS Martinez. Gmail OK. Like so that I can have a versioning control from what we're doing here so that I don't lose any work. And also I want you to create some pipelines for me, so some scripts. Shell scripts from like that you can then you yourself will be able to be able to run. Here in my mac so that we update the git. Every session and maybe some appraisal commands and stuff like that and like please add those to me and also like update the agents file as well.

Nice. Now make it so that every time that I open this code and disproge it, you know like all the scripts and through these agents file, right? I'm not sure if agents MD is the correct file for our copilot to read. I think maybe it's something like inside a folder for copilot. Not sure. If you could check for me it would be best OK yeah. Please do that.

Perfect. Now for the appraisal scripts, I want you to create a folder that we should be called like personas or critics or something like that. And that we will have like some typical personas that would be reading the type of book that I'm going to do. And from that that like persona style you will give me like. Evaluation right? So like what this persona would understand and would it dissection be good or not? So like that's one of the things that we should be evaluating, maybe it could be a 2nd type of appraisal like we can we can have this having the script appraisal of like how well written and how big the the document is and like overall style and like some farmer metadata. Evaluation and also another appraisal focusing on like what would this persona hypothetical persona? Be feeling well. Let's create these scripts, maybe some more variations on that. Then I would tell you some personas first to start with the personas, then later we will start with the content

OK. So for the personas you should first think like what's the optimal structure for us to write the personas probably like each persona be its own file, but also like what the file should have, like OK. Probably all files should be MD files right now, like not splint text but. Yeah, rich text like MD. Probably. Right, right. OK and for the Personas. What we should have probably like a name from them and quick like one liner summary of like what what they are so that I can see it quickly when you evaluate and print devaluation for me. And probably stuff like where they live, some form of small biography like what they like or what they what's their age or something like that and like their base knowledge, right, something like that. You could you should probably. Research some papers or some typical persona templates that people use for this type of project and. Yeah, and after you did that, like let's create 5 personas OK. So first. Umm, first we want the. Typical Brazilian businessman working class. Umm is smart graduate umm. Young, probably between like in their 30s. And yeah, and should be someone that's. Probably engineer our tech savvy or something about that around that OK. Then secondly, we should think about some form of like a lawyer. Maybe a bit older, like in the 40s. Desire could be a woman. And thinking more about human rights and more political and so on. Then 3rd we could take a teenager, probably like in the lady, late late teens, so 818 years old, 19 so. The that super engaged and start went to learn about the world and all that but doesn't have much knowledge outside left on Youtube and short time span media and stuff like that. But it is smart like it's engaged just not that usage like. Read this deep looks. Then. We should also have someone from the other audience. Probably a grandpa or someone. Lady 60s, 70s, like, not too old. That could be like. Late in their career, are already not working anymore and could be a bit more conservative. In their point of view, but who has a good heart, right, they have big family. So, so yeah, I think that's also another good perspective for us to add and and yeah, maybe add one more to personalities as well.

Cool, so the first idea that I want to draw is like. What's the center idea of the book? I'm not sure if the center but like one of the things holding everything together OK so. It's the it's about like, umm. The power of selection. Or power of iteration. Are like how world systems like they work so. I want to like. I want to compare a bunch of different systems and topics and from them like try to. Explain the way II, view the world OK so better for me because I'm going to go like I want to say just one single idea here. I would probably say quite a few scattered ideas and then. Yeah, yeah, and help me figure it out like how how to write those up OK. Yeah, I'll probably be always doing this by voice, so text might not be as organized as possible like the inputs that I give you. So if you want to. Address that in your agents MD, our copilot file there so that you know that probably is going to be your job to organize stuff, figure out files and all of that. Because I probably won't know them. I probably just know and like do really hands on writing myself a dance at the end, because by the end I will want to have it written as the way I do usually write, but at the same time. Right now is mostly talking OK, so just bear in mind that. But yeah, yeah, you can also type your like write down how I tend to write. So as we do more and more of these inputs you become more and more similar like you write down more and more similar how I do write down but, but. I kind of write a bit like I'm talking but not right because as you can see, this is clearly a way for someone to say right

Sure, let's go. So one of the things like natural selection, right? So. Let's run selection as ages. Best like ages. Go on people. Like people, the animals, the Biome like it evolves, right? And. Devolution itself is not driven by like 0. This is clearly better, it's just more optimized by the the medium around it. Just so you know I'm Brazilian OK so my main language is Portuguese. I'm doing this in English because I think it's better for AI and also it's good for me to train English so sometimes I won't be saying like the native word. Just just so you know if you want to write down copilot as well. You're learning how I speak and also maybe some of the sentences so you know how to fix them. But yeah, aside from that, going back to the natural selection, let's think of a car concepts here, right, so. The the median like the the uh. Environment around the. Living being. It defines over the time how does that species evolves, right? If it's some place that has a ton of food, then probably like that. Living being won't need to be as efficient with food if it's something that's super low on food. That species will probably, as time evolves, be more right on being efficient. And getting food OK. So that's an example, right? Just a depth one. I'll probably think of a better one noted write it down like I'll think of a better example later, but just some quicker quick dumb example here. So yeah, So what I'm saying here is iteration like we need a lot of. Selection of so breathing mutation, animals, dying animals. New generations coming up a little bit differently and then as as times goes by, like only the the fittest survive. To that environment and and yeah, so that's that's how they evolve OK so so that's one car idea here. There are a ton of things that we can could be done about Metro selection. So we so, so yeah, I'll I'll keep it open right now. But you see as I give more examples and more topics like on stuff that we should be talking about it.

Keep in mind that I always want you to like update several documents not just one at the same time because as I talk about 1 document, maybe this should affect another document, so we should be always like pushing and connecting documents. So I want you to feel free on doing that those OK. Again, update copilot and yeah, and probably most of my inputs here won't like as a because I'm saying. It's not super structured like so in the same input here I can kind of ask you to do more than one thing. OK. So I will need you to multitask here and like touch upon a few different things. So all inputs that I gave you like try to break down into tasks and topics and like things that you should search and cross up for me.

Right now you are just editing like one small file at once and then like doing the sync script like I don't think you need to. You need to do sync like every single time that I do. Any change OK you you can do it like every once in a while. Like every three prompts or something like that? Yeah, like at least like when when we have a few files. Change it together like this need to be like just one commute per line or simply that. I think maybe that's too much OK. And also like just pointing out like you should have some fire somewhere writing down like some meta analysis about how I speak stuff like what are key topics or keywords or key examples that I use all the time. This will help you. And me and to help us later to figure out like how should stuff be written down, like what's their most important examples are like car ideas that center and connect with a lot of other ideas.

Perfect. Love the things that they just written down. It makes sense. So yeah, let's keep going. So. We just talking about natural selection. We'll go dive deeper later that not too late, but yeah, we'll soon talk more about it, but when? Car aspect as well far as you think about here is about machine learning. So. How does AI learn so quickly right because you create like this value functions and then you have this training data and then you run through it and like AI starts from a random out output and then going through this value functions they get evaluated and the more we iterate the better they get into like doing. This like to get better at in getting better and higher values for their own value function OK. So it's again about iteration how many times? It has quite a few components like so iteration, the quality of the value, the quality and like how the learning process happens. Like there are ton of different algorithms and approach and also like algorithms that's a keyword OK. I probably don't want to use the algorithm as the main title or something from like that because I don't want this to be too much like computer science. It's it's more political or more like philosophical about the world. So I don't want the readers to only be from computer science OK but. But yeah, I'll probably have a lot of computer science examples. To give you. So yeah, so machine learning, like it does have like this car concepts here that if you think about it, they have a lot of similarities with natural selection, right, because it's all about iteration, it's about the value function, it's about optimization for. Like in this. In this case like the environment will be the value function, right? So. So mutations like they happen both cases like there are a lot of parallel and similarities here

Nice. I want you to also write down about me, like about the altar OK. So just to know who I am like, and I feel my biases. So I am a computer engineer. From Scala Polytechnica of University of San Paulo. I'm 33 years old. I'm a really creative person. I do. Like great games like since childhood. Bar games and digital games and. I'm quite social, but a bit of an introvert as well. I love mathematics and history, biology and. Yeah, like all the sciences, so. Yeah, and. Not that good in literature, so I will need some help like researching stuff later. But yeah, I love psychology as well, even though I didn't read as much. So yeah, we need some help in that regards because. Ditch upon topics that could be categorized as college, OK and. As my work like like. So do general enterprises and then II entered a startup was I was program programmer then like product designer there. Product Manager. I kind of started there, but then I went to Adlife for a creative games from hackathons. I like this creative person OK. I have a bunch of ideas and like usually what I do is merging ideas. Together to create something new like I think that's kind of what I'm good at. So yes, I've created these games and then II quickly grew the company and started leading some big projects in the company launched one of the biggest games, Disco. Very that. It was quite big worldwide, like nothing. Extra huge, but yeah, good enough. And then I try to create my own startup. To like trying to digitize board games bring. People together and all that. It didn't work out. So like the company, I had to close the company. After a few years trying it. So yeah, like that's more or less the background. I love teaching. I did some volunteer jobs and that not that much, but I did some. And yeah, and I'm happy with the state of the world right now. I'm not a pessimistic. I'm a optimistic person. But at the same time. Yeah, I can see so many stuff going wrong. So, like, one of the purpose of the book here is that I want people to see the world. A bit of how I see it. So like they can try to understand how why some things are going on the way they are going on so that. We as a society can start to think together like what we should be doing.

Nice questions. I do just have. Umm, let's think about those OK, shall we? Don't hate the player. Hate the game. Like that. That's one really good sentence that a lot of people say and like, encompass parts of the the ideas here, right? I think it's implies a bit or like it's not well structured. For people at least the the sentence itself, but it could very well be like that. The the charts the TLDR for this for this book OK. 'cause yeah, yeah, like. This book will merge like. Algorithms. Natural selection and like systems and how those shape. Politics, how those shape economics, how those shape over time like time is one of the car aspects of iteration and. A lot of people don't figure that out right? People say, oh, something worked in the past or like 0. How low these past 10 years were good? Like clearly we should still doing this or that and people don't understand how like. Choices compounds over time, right as. Time goes by like. Things I wouldn't say go get more extreme, but they get more optimized for whatever it is, the value function, the algorithm, the. Incentives for. The current process like what's the algorithm? Right. So like that's always happening through time. OK. So like oh, we love capitalism OK. But yeah, but capitalism over time will make revenue more. Merit concentrate. I'm not sure how to say that in English. So yeah, like over time, right. And and and like, one thing that people don't get also about capitalism is like. Capitalism tries to do this exponential curve of money concentration in the hands of a few. But this exponential curve. It depends on how many people you have. You can have a more extreme version. Like a small group. Has so much richness, like it's limited the amount of richness that they have. So the richest person can't be that rich or that richer than the rest. And as you grow in amount of people. The amount of. Richness, I don't that's not the correct term. Uh, gross. So the exponential curve, like it's kind of the same, but it gets more extreme in the sense that the amount of power that one person gets gets bigger and bigger.

No, no politics. I don't want to talk about corruption like we could, but I don't think we need to. Umm, I think what's bigger and pressing matter that probably more interesting to talk about politics. Just find out like probably I will be talking about politics later in the book because. Maybe hinting at it at first, but I think it's good to have the lens for the politics after we have like the framework. But to be discussing about it, if you want to have like a resource II, love the book Wide Nations Fails. Well, I probably mentioned this book quite a few times. In my own just because II. Love how they create this view. Of how the world works. So yeah, so I would love to try to do something similar in the sense of. Trying to create a lens and then as we go deeper into chapters and stuff like that, we should like discussing a lot about each of the components of this framework that we've built. And probably politics would be an example, right? So probably not the first thing on the book OK at least an idea right now, not, not, not super sure, but going back from politics itself, like what I think it's more interesting to talk about. Let's talk about marketing, democracies, voting and time, right? Because let's think about it. Every person has one vote, so. Umm, the value function is quite clear here, right? You need votes to stay in power. From one point of view you would say that we have like people who doesn't don't care about staying in power forever. Or staying in power too much because like they just want to do like their parts and then leave like there are people like that, but. Let's be real, like a lot of people love when they love something, when when they start doing something, they tend to use this type of thing forever because like that, that's who they are. Like they're it's hard for people to transition, right? So if they are politicians for a lot, for some time, it's hard, it's it becomes harder for them to change because that's in their curriculum. That's what they know about like their social networks. Around that. And as they do it, they get better at it and then figure out more stuff that you can do it right. So whenever people start something, they. Tend to stay on like I wouldn't say they don't pivot and on change areas, but it's harder for like a doctor to then become a lawyer, right. Then yeah, you could say like a doctor start like doing business on medicine or like so. So it's a pivot and a changing career, but not, not like the biggest change ever, right. So the same thing for politics like it's usually harder, right. So OK, so thinking about that. You have to think about like OK so hundred. S and thousands of people every year try to enter politics. They. Grow in politics, right? So you have this random assessment of people just. As we talking about random algorithms or random natural sections, right? So random assessments of people with different purposes trying to do stuff, people who are good at communication, communicating who people who are. More introverts. Extroverts good at relationships, know the names of everyone, remember stuff. They have good memories. People who are good about explaining stuff and and so and so on, right? And so far, so you have like all these different behaviors. Sorry, I just got it here. And then. And then, yeah, like who? Who? Who wins, right? Who? Who becomes the president? Or who stays in the Senate forever? Or like who? Who points out to the judge and stuff like that like. It varies by country, right? But in the the profile of politicians that come up, they usually have something in common, right? And. That's usually based on the value function from politics, right? So it's based on like how they get votes are like how they grew their own social network to be more more influential. And have more and more power so that they can keep doing what they are doing be. A center for like forever in Brazil. Are trying to become a president and bring our own agenda. So, yeah, so and so like how we do it then, right. And when you think about politics, like it's a medium that change it a lot in the past few years because of the Internet and yeah, yeah, like that. That's something that we're talking about a lot. Like the Internet how things change it and so on. I'll let you write down stuff and I keep going on this topics.

On the books side, like also write down, umm, stolen focus. It's a good book as well. Umm, it talks like a pressing matter for current day and age. So like one of the it's more about the consequences of what the social media landscape has done. So it's probably good. Later I would like to try to talk about like the consequences of the algorithms that we the systems that we create around the world. More than about. How the systems do that, like about how the systems do that we could do is the documentary like The Social Dilemma. It's a good documentary and talking about like what Facebook and all the social medias they are doing and also we we probably like 1 other topic here for us. So yeah like. Social media and like their attention economy like all of that. Like why do? Those companies do what they are doing. Like, are they evil? Is there, is there a conspiracy here? Like, no, they're not like. Every system people can coordinate, definitely. But in the end, people, individuals are like anything like that. Like it's always it's on. Person on its own minds trying to do its own thing. Uh. So it has its own range of ideas and tests and of that and then the system. Filters what works OK so if. The Internet. Has grew from the idea of free. Sharing. For everyone like this, this idea is super nice, right? It's it's kind of topic, right? Let's let's give knowledge for everyone, for free. Let's give services for everyone, like the Internet for everyone. It's super beautiful. I did believe in that. But we have to think about consequences and that's when cara specs here as well. Consequences. Everything has consequences. Like everything that we are doing has always shaped up environment OK. So. If the Internet is free by default and if the Internet is the first thing, then connect billions of people so. If in the past it was slow to get information across and geography mattered a lot in terms of a lot of things. From knowledge, media, communications and so forth. Like the Internet is the first thing that has so much people. And it's free. But like, how it's free? Like it's not free, right? So it has to be paid by something 'cause. Staff costs should be made and we live in a world that you need money to do stuff and you also want money like that. That's one of the incentives for people to create the companies in the 1st place, right? So. So yeah, like when when you fit together a few components and Oh yeah, that's also a good thing, components here. So when you're thinking about systems, you have to think about different. Components are like half different. Aspects of the environment, how they match, and depending on how they match, emergent behavior appears emergent behavior. That's a good term. As well, so yeah. Free service for billions of people. Connecting everyone but it costs and people want to get money. How would you do it right? Umm, you can do it either one. By selling engagement, selling. Advertisement like for people are. Secondly, you can. Get a **** ton of money from few people to pay for everyone. So when talk about whales in games are. Whales are like high spenders OK. So when we talk about like someone spending. **** ton of money gambling like, oh, it's super sad. That's a person spent it. But at the same time this one person that spent $1000. They helped the operations for the developers to create this product for the other 900 people. Their app, right. So you either get revenue from everyone because that's from engagement. Or you get a **** ton of money from some people and for you to get a ton of money from some people you you need to go to addiction, to gambling. You are statuses right? So from fashion and and like some form status, yes social. Recognition, right? So yeah, so quite a few ideas here for you to write down

Let's define a bit more about the way you select. That's not a concept that most people know about or like. They don't think much. So yeah, so. Like one thing that I saw quite a lot like. Let's talk about gaming. So yeah, gaming. It's free. Let's play Fortnite. Everyone can play it, right? So super casual, super easy for everyone. And yeah, I like what could go wrong. A lot. You have ton of people and you need to make money for you to develop like the schemes and develop the content and and release the game for people, right. So. You have to monetize somehow and you don't want to be right, so you need to to do skins. But Patriot could work as well like. What's the percentage of people that you think that pay? For a game like. Spanish super low, right. You're talking about 10%, 1% of users that convert like the other 99%, 90%? They never pay anything like from this one percent of payers. One to 10% of players like one to 10% of dan would be high spenders or Wales, right so. And like this one percent of the whales, like 1% of the 1% of the whales, like they are super whales that spend thousands of of dollars and some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if I'm not mistaken there was there are few games that achieved millions of dollars from single player. And like, this can be like unimaginable. Like, holy **** how could someone do that? Like, don't add holy **** in that book, please. You can write down that I said it, but no. No forbidden words please in in the book itself, but yeah. So imagine this, right? It is 1% of the 1% of people. They spend so much. And when you do the end like when you do the averages, right, because games need to reach people and to reach people they do ads. And to do ads they have to market themselves and to market themselves. Like you have the cost to show for people, so like. With all this math, you could have like an average of spending like $1, 1 1/2 dollars per per dollar, $2 per download, and you need to earn like $3 for dollars per dollar. Probably more, right? The rules return of investments should be positive, but yeah, don't need to be super technical here. Remember, like a lot of people here are not from tech, are not for economics and that, but yeah, but we we need to explain enough, right? So yeah, so like we have this really small percentage of people that then they're paying and like how is that possible, right. So first you need to do again. That has deep content and you can can't be spent a lot on. So gotcha is a good example, but you could have like the Super pricey skins you can have like temporary. Currency or something that's consumable? So like it's kind of our games that like more games for you to like spend on troops and then when two players fight between each other, like they kill each other's troops. So they are like essentially killing burning money from non player against the other. Yeah, that's essentially what they're doing and they're doing that for status for like showing off for their own goods. So like the game designer, the game designer, which is usually a system designer, they need to create incentives, they need to create the rules. Like so what's the objective? What are the key factors like what what the levers like the the player can use? To try to go through that game and be the best, right? Umm, so yeah, like a system, a system designer, a game developer, in essence, in the multiplayer game or in a game like, they're creating their own system, like their own environment, natural section and so far, right. So yeah. So you can have these high speeders. Try to do that. Are being on top of fashion and be the best players there, right? So that's also. A good example. So yeah ton of ways for us to either spend a lot of for you to play forever right so the the game need need also to bring your attention span as much as possible so like. Let's do Sunday requests and and so far, right, so the type of games that appear on mobile versus the types of games that appear on PC. Different. And they are super different exactly because of the key incentives on each platform, right? It's not the developers are evil or anything like that, it's just that. It's harder for you to create in mobile a game. That won't be. That much suited and optimize it into deep meta games and play progressions. Because if you do a game like that, you probably won't earn as much money per user, and if you don't earn as much money per user you won't be able to market. And if you want to pay be able to market you won't be able to grow. And if you are not able to grow, you are not able to pay your employees. So you're. Her not be able to create your own game. So like it the as you do it the more of a gamble it is so it's harder right. So yeah so like there's a type of game that can be done in in mobile landscape and. See landscape like. It slowly churned changing, right? But at the same time, like, we have like all of those forces of people trying to do stuff. This is not about evil. It's just like about odds. Like, would you do something trying to fail? Just because. You love it like in Mar, and you think the rest is wrong. And even if you fail, at least you did the right thing like. And a lot of people would, and these are beautiful words, but not it's not black and white like. We could go deeper into like, oh, you're OK with doing it. We're not OK with doing gambling, but you like it. Magic the Gathering, which you opened Busters and maybe get a rare sticker. So is that gambling? And then oh no, no. Magic the Gathering is like, too much. Of a gambling game OK. So then what then? You only have to pay for. Exactly knowing what you are going to get, like, that's the car thing here. Or you have to pay only before you play something like you can't release a DLC because OK. If you don't accept gotcha, then I'll give you a DLC right? It's another way. So yeah, there's there's always something for you to hate

Yeah, time. Let's talk about time. Uh. I think one of the best ways for us to find time is like the easiest ones would be with. Umm. Money, money and compound interest. And investments like. Say we've created a system. That if you have. Sitting money. So you have extra money, right? And if you've you invested it. In the Treasury OK. So. In Brazil right now as 2025 our. Silk rate. No, no Silic. SELIC. Yeah, yeah, that's right. So the silic rate OK, you cannot translate it in real time, but it you will figure out once you read the input. So this rate is about like the compound rate, uh it's interest rate country, it's right now it's 15% OK which is huge like. Let's just think about it, say. I have 100K dollars. City still. By Dandoff next year, I will be 115. And I won't have done anything. Write a joke. This money just appeared. Out of lower. Imagine like the working class in Brazil, like the minimum wage is like. 1K, 1K and a half, something like that. I talk in Brazilian hairs, but I like the numbers don't really matter. I probably should write down the correct numbers. Because of accuracy and for the book, kind of that. Like people, definitely. Complain. People love to cherry pick bad examples to complain and disregard your arguments. So yes, be correct the numbers. And later you can search it or you can search it now right correct numbers as. As of right now. November, December 2025. So yes, like in one year by doing nothing this. Richer person. It's not super richer richer person that had 100K and doing nothing. It generated more money than someone that worked the whole year. And by doing nothing right. And let's say that like they doesn't, they don't need that money. That year, right. If they don't need that money that year, so next year will be A115 that would compound so. Yeah, on my head would be hard to do this math, but it's probably A135 or something like that. That would be by the end of the year. You could check the math. And and do the math for me like in 5 years. In five years, like it would be so much money that every money every year actually. That person would be doing. The money worth of like three people from the minimum wage. So like it started as one person and then became three people, and. And yeah, and and this gets worse over time. OK. So, so it's quite obvious here. Like it's crystal clear right now here, right. This single system that was designed by someone. About. Interest rates and lending money. It has one consequence. That richer people. We'll get richer faster than poorer people like by default OK. I'm now talking about these other consequences. Look like there are other consequences like. This is a good way for people who were poorer to get richer and like investments. In part it has a lot of **** OK, but I'm focusing on this one and II want the book to always talk about things having more consequences, like. I'm not talking about evil or good. I'm talking about systems and consequences. Like what are the levers? That define the value function for our system OK. And. So so something that. At the beginning you designed it was working. Maybe in ten years or 20 years or 50 years the error from the system that you created. It will compound. And as it compounds like, it becomes clearer and clearer like. How? Impossible. That is right. Because like this minimum wage person and this person who was doing nothing like in a few in a few years time, like they would be so far apart that like one person will be like getting more money than 10, 2015 people by doing nothing right. And and just because of time, just because time passes right 'cause they want the person who had the minimum wage never got the chance to start. Stocking money. And since they didn't do it, they just are far and because now. A lot of years. Have already compounded. It's kind of. It's Passover dueling. It's no longer. And it's no longer feasible. Like it won't matter for them to just start. Getting money after 100 years because like, the differences between who has too much and who has too little, like would be so big then. Then yeah, it would be, wouldn't be relevant, right. So at some point. Like maybe in 500 years times from now. If capitalism is the same, probably like compounding money won't matter. Like the the poor person won't matter at all if they start. Trying to get money because yeah, there will be too, too much fun behind, right. So it completely impossible if the environment doesn't change, which something that's also important and we will note it probably natural selection and maybe similar places about how, yeah. If the environment was always the same, we would have like the Super strong optimized stuff for like this environment, but. The truth is that environment changes as well, because as stuff evolve, they also change back the environment. So it's there's a feedback loop loop there, right? And the environment changes a bit. So like what's the value change, the value function also changes.

I want to give more ideas right now so we can get deeper and stronger here. We won't need to add everything to the book, right? So probably having more is better than having less. And so I went to add about again about the iteration. The power of iteration itself like. And we can talk about viruses and covet, like that's all good example for people because super recent and people, people remember what happened, right? So talking about like the mutations. We don't need to go deep into this, right? We can just. Quickly gloss over, right. I'm talking about like, oh, people remember like OK. So one of the car, one of the key things is that it was a disease that wasn't little like easily little like the percentage of vitality was not that high, but the, the percentage of. Contagio not sure. Not sure how to say that in in English like the the the. Rated pass front person to another like it's. I don't remember that there was a specific keyword for that. It's super high, so. And it. Takes a long time for people to diagnose and perceive that they are already transmitting. So like if you think about it like, it has the car components for an epidemic. An epidemic is like the value function for a virus, right? Because the virus which is also already like AA debate if it's living thing or not. But in the end like even if it's not a living thing, even if it's not a living thing, that's also a fun thing to say non living things also. Work by. The system's power. That's something cool to talk about it just to drive people, because people talk about like, oh, there's like this conspiracy theory and all of that. Or the minds of people like the no, no, this. The power of iteration is so strong that even things that does not have conscience or are not living they also. Follow this rule. OK we need to figure out the name of it and like what's the concept? Viruses. Then they they want to spread as much as possible and. Covid had. The Kerfings and then people started vaccinating and doing and quarantine and all of that, and it became harder for Covid and then Covid, but people didn't need like 100 percent and because of that I didn't que the Furious completely eradicated. So what happened? Most of the viruses just just ventured, but the few which did it. They reproduce it and the virus mutated and become became even more contagious, right? Not that, and it was super visible quickly. How quickly it would evolve it right. And it did evolve because of the iterations. Like it's iterations power. You could like just gloss over like the same thing about insects and like poison. Like toxic. Like you, you, you, you do like this. Spray to cure insects and like this brain needs to change every decade or so. You probably should research that 'cause I might be wrong here, but I think it's that good or 20 years or so. But I owed poison doesn't kill insects because they cured their. Generations of ancestors so like the ones that survive it, like they doesn't, they don't die anymore from that, right 'cause so it's super quick iterations like. They they they have the power of rotating stuff. And if you think about it. Iteration. It's all about time. It's just that if you do fast iterations you have have a huge amount and if you have a higher mutation degree then maybe you need less time. So like it's it's awesome form of equation here, right? Time against iterations against mutation rates. Like what's the? Learning curve. To adapt to this value function, right? That's the curving here. So it applies to COVID, it applies to viruses, it applies to insects. Yeah it it can apply as to police and robbers to rock hackers and anti hackers like this cat and mouse you can talk about that in natural selection about. Predators and prey running on Safari like typical example for natural selection here. And yeah, yeah, like and this is natural selection one like you can also talk about like how the animals over the time. Godfather. And faster and faster because like, that was the coffee here, right? Or they got bigger and bigger during the dinosaurs and then after some reset, like getting bigger was not what matter anymore, but like being stealthier and being group play right, group play **** bigger animals.

I think it will be interesting to talk about umm like this non living stuff. We can't we can talk about like how ideas is spread and like. What an idea. Be a living thing, right? No, it's it's not living thing. So why does it spread, right? So it's quite similar. So that's something power right here that's just like how it directs. It just works like just happens, right? So yeah, I think that's. That would be also good thing for us too. Elaborate as well. Yeah, education could be also a good example, so. Let's talk about education and. How time progress, right? Let's think about schools. At first. Teachers will teach. Students. In several different ways. Like there 'cause there are teachers that are more. Market driven. More citizen driven, citizenship driven, right there. There could be a lot of different ways, right, so. At first you have schools that are more folks than on universities and passing exams more. For the rich, for the poor, for the real smart, for, for being inclusive, for being sparse driven and all, and so on and so on, right? So you have this random sample. And then. As each year pass you have students that go to University A or that go to University B. And parents? That are worried about their. Son. Future might prefer a school that delivers. They stood it. Trabajar diversity, like overall, right? Have better odds. So what happens then? Which school would have a better arts? The school that teaches more the subjects that will. Go in the excel are. The school that teaches more about life and about how to be a better human being or how to understand your own self better or. Or like even how to be the best? Employees ever or however, right? This school that teaches better how to pass in an exam in the long run will probably. Have better students. And be more competent to enter and will be able to. Kosmar like higher prices, like higher higher values so more more schools will see those debt and will try to do that as well and. The long run? As years goes by, every school. Will be doing this right? They will be all trying to be the best in the exams possible, right? So. What defines what a school teaches? Is the subject of the exam. And the subject of the exam is just. Some random thing that the university decided that would be important for. To be able like to OK like those people are acceptable, then the government changes it, right? And changes it and like try to create this so so define it out all schools. Because of that, right? So it's not about citizenship and teaching students something that will be useful in their lives, but not in the immediate term. So let's say. How to be better in handling your own economics? Finances, finances, right so. Like 100 percent of the people would be better off by learning financial control. But school? Schools, they don't teach it right and why they don't teach it because it's not in the exams. So it's not about left or right views of politics or anything like that. Is just about. The value function right? So and over time schools get fitted. Into this evaluation just point out that also like. As every school. Becomes exam driven. Not being exam driven becomes a differential as well. So you have this emergent behavior of, this emergent value function behavior of like desirability of being the. The only one that teaches. About civil rights or about financial? Control, personal financial control, right. So it's clear. And that's because become like not something that randomly appears, but strategically, some elite schools. Would differentiate themselves, so. Like poorer schools? Like more social schools. Definitely won't teach those things, but. Richard. Will, and sorry for the long input here, but just so that we can keep going the chain of thoughts probably should write down a ton of stuff here. Because every. Thing has consequences. OK. So a system. Has an environment that defines a value function that iterations changes the players, and as the players change, the value function itself changes because there are consequences and as there are consequences. Environment changes and everything like keeps looping like that over time and the error compounds OK so going back like so we just talking about how most schools. Become about passing universities. And some rich schools. They differentiate themselves. About teaching civil rights and stuff that wouldn't be a. Devaluation. Then what will you you you get is that you start getting. These left centered. People that are rich. The caviar rich people, as here in Brazil, people say like the. They are rich, but they are left centered and they are thinking about human rights and all of that because they learned that from school, right? Because their school. Becomes, as time passes, more left centered right. So you you create this political bias. I eat this part of the population. Because like all the other, like the the poorer. Ones don't get these learnings in school, so. It's not that everyone's left centered like it's more than the rich ones become like this. Type of people and as these people value education and get left centered, they might enter. Politics and after a few decades, change the exams so that the exams themselves become more left centered. But then you have to think, oh, if the exams now have topics that are in another direction. What's the consequences?

I probably should change, but I just had. I said to like, it's bad to have more examples than less and then we'll probably future as we go. But just all the ideas just thought about like. Fake news. Like probably could just talk about like fake news and how they spread and like they are. No not they are not living right so. Some some examples about the algorithms of social media. Could be good here. Just to explain why figliuos would grow or like some type of leos, grow more than others, like about anger and all that. Mentioned in the last Focus book as an example. Another way example that we couldn't live is like this story of Youtube. I think it's a good example because it's super simple. At first Youtube was would recommend. Videos based on. Number of views. So what we would see is this super short videos like 10 seconds long, five seconds long that will be like the the memes, the memes right they so. The squirrel looking back at you like 0, that's a lot of that stuff, right? And then. Early days of the Internet. so. They saw it like they changed it. It so that would be watch time. They wanted to change like the content, so they tried to recommend based on how much. Availability totally viewed like that would prank the videos and that would suggest. Videos for people. So what happens is that those short videos, they venture and then Youtube started having this really long videos and which type of channel? Screw the the type of channels that would be Let's Play. Right, because for you to record yourself, play our community stuff. Is way quicker than you like doing like say news Youtube channel. 'cause our animation show because like the amount of work per minute displayed is way higher. I'm not saying that let's plays are better, I'm just saying that I'm out of work per minute is higher. Like usually let's play cello outputs way more minutes. Of video. Than any other type of channel. OK just as podcasts have grew as well like the same the same sense OK so so it was watch time and I'll turn off channels died because of that and a turn off like and this Let's Play community appeared and and super fun because like Let's Play appeared at the same time as Minecraft and Minecraft was like the best game so let's play at the moment so it grew organically in a time that marketing was. Almost free in the Internet because way less people were doing it, so it was possible for this phenomenal phenomenon to appear. So so yeah, like you change it gaming forever, this let's play and it was done by like an algorithm in Youtube. So it's random consequence. And then they saw it and like Youtube tried to change the other team again because it was basically becoming gaming platform and they didn't want that. So like how to change it and the algorithm for you to change it a lot. Like it became more and more complex and. Interested people should take a look because super interesting, like every era of Youtube did break different types of content. Any kind of crystal clear of like what type of content appeared so you can kind of imagine like what the charts and rios from Tiktok and Youtube. Are changing the content itself that appears, but we don't need to go that. I prefer to talk about the early days of Youtube.

Before talking about solutions, I think we should converge. Right, so. Can you list for me like all the concepts? That I've written so far. Probably you should read again on the pages.

I want to build a framework so. Those dots kind of connect, but it's not obvious how they connect OK. I want to try to connect those all of them OK. So like how iteration and time and consequences and evolution and mutation. Like how they are synergize like like mathematics like can we do an equation or some form of framework that can be visually seen or easily explained in some sentences like the Cartesis here like. Be like the. The violations, failures, simple extractive versus. Inclusive and so on, right? So yeah, like. How can we synthesize like everything that we just said and so just so that you know like what, what are the solutions direction? I'm not trying to solve any of the points that that's one of the car ideas of having a lot of topics is that I'm not trying to explain and solve one of them. I want people. To have the correct mind set about how to go solving. Them and that's probably why. The more examples the better. And probably I will have more examples because. It will be good to give more and more and more examples like how changes and things effects each other OK so, so probably we'll have more future but just going back like. The solution? For like. Not telling a lot of things, like how they went wrong, like I'm just telling how things went the way they went. And why people? Complain like about those like they didn't appear from out of nowhere. It's not that things went wrong, we could do like examples. From things going well as well, right? So we can say why capitalism move on over. Socialism. During the last century, right? We can talk about like, how. Having incentives to create your own. Umm your ideas and sharing them and like trying to. Creature and entrepreneurship. Like, which is one of the car things from Why Nation's Fair right? We can like quickly quote them, right? So. By having a more inclusive system that would allow you to create your own II idea, share it and profit from it like this would make people try to bring umm technology and development and so forth. And because of that, in the long run it would start growing right while. Social socialism doesn't have like this incentive. When it's, think about the value. Preposition. The thing is that's super hard for the topic communism to work. So socialism with the. Real communism, right, is the feasible one in the sense that someone needs to govern still, right? If the someone's needs to govern, there is some power hierarchy, and if there's some power hierarchy, there's some value function going on here. That is not money because it's not capitalism so. It's power. And if it's power, not money, it's influence. And if it's influence, it's about who knows and what favor you want all to each other and. And so forth. II. Probably need to research more to talk about socialism, but just talk about it like just Spire this out and. Keep a note about studying more. In the future so that I can explain better. The Soviet Union, right? Yeah, I think that's a good example and that's also a good example over time. So like capitalism won against socialism for the same reason that nowadays people don't hate capitalism because of. Compounds air. OK so. At the beginning, entrepreneurship. Would be all about. Having an idea trying it out. Selling to people as. Smart people did that. We started having bigger investors. That would give money fire to create your own idea because investors wanted to join these entrepreneurs, right? The investor is someone who's already has the money, right? And they want to join the fund. Like they don't have the idea, they don't have the creativity or the. Time to put into this new stuff and this new risk. But they have money so they they want to join the risk and it can be for can be just for profit but it can also be for a good reason like they do when they want to do good to the world. So investors are not bad people even though some people think about it. But if you. Think up and even though I said about like compound rates and stuff like that, like it's not bad OK. That's something that I want people to think about it. But as we have more investors. Doing the entrepreneurships, we start having venture capitals. And engine investors and of that? And as you'll start having. Engine investors and venture captives. You start having entrepreneurs that don't don't need to have profits. Since the beginning. So if in the past century, like companies, we need to be have profits super early, like the past few decades, that was no longer the case. Because they can grow by burn money, burning money, right? And if they are growing, more investors want to join this company, so you get even more investors, so has have even less desire. On having profit and if you have even less desire, you start growing even more. And then suddenly profits no longer. Something that matters. And investor investments become like. An end in itself is no longer the mean, because if you invest, someone will later invest and buy what you invested, so you earn money about it. And if talking about parameter schemes, it looks like it because someone's always buying what the other one sold, so it doesn't matter. The profit it matters the. Promise of a future profit or the amount of size that you are. So what start happening is that. The entrepreneurs that really grow? Maybe not. The best ones in making money, but they're probably the best ones about convincing. And investors and venture captives. So it's another type of entrepreneur that's more marketing oriented just. As the politicians that we just said, right, so you can see like the, the. And then as that happens, investors like there's so many investors and so much money being poured into new ideas. What's happening is like you have start getting the concentration of investments. As a by product. Of this, all of this, right? So you start having fewer companies getting bigger and bigger and bigger seeds and precedes because venture capitals like they need even more money because they don't need profits. Like just by having money you can burn it and it can have the promise so that if if you can raise more money than the other. You're more likely to get even more money after because it's. Like people want to even more right 'cause the promise will get even bigger because like it's kind of self self appealing prophecy. Because reality doesn't matter anymore. Like in terms of like current results. What matters like the is that you raise it so much money and you have so much promise that just because you have so much promise and raise that so much money, you probably should raise more and. Who doesn't want to be on the the place that everyone is investing, right? So start creating this bubble of investments and that's probably right where we are right now with the Magnificent 7. And the big tax and bubble of AI and all that. So, yeah, so it's funny, right? Because that's just compounding effects of entrepreneurship and investments and capitalism of the centers, right?

*User:* "Is there a way for us to have like the raw inputs that I gave you? Like log it somewhere? Maybe a script that gets this chat history and compounds it like in some form of document. Just we we can run it from time to time just because later we could review like what I said and what we write written down. I think what it is written down is all correct, but I think it might be good to have like the. Ryan puts themselves so that we can like later try to like start telling kind of similar on the way of that I write."

## Session 2: Solutions & System Design Mindset (2025-12-02)
OK, I think we can talk a bit about solutions. So solutions, they're not solutions. OK umm, I mean it's more about once you are aware than like. How these systems evolve? Over time. Then you should start thinking just like. A system designer and that's probably when like. Game game theory and like things that are teached in game design universities will be most useful here, right? And probably we should do some research and some anecdotes of like. System designs and features changes. From game designers and like how those fixed. Issues. That the games we're having so like the car behavioring behavior here. Is that whenever a game is not? Working the way it was intended so like say have too many toxic players or engagement is low or. Users are exploiting. A system wherever like the problem is like the designer. It doesn't. Complaints against users like they don't fight against that user. If they start fighting, they will lose, right? And it will be kind of useless whatever they do. A designer, they what they do is they change the rules. They do balance patches. Umm, they change features? They add new features? So they change stuff, right? And that's the car mentality, like that's how. You. Change the environment. Enable iterations and enable variations. So that the output the outcome is the one that you desired, right? So just as. Dog breeding are like pets breeding. It's something that humans choose to like. Find the. The races they were after, like the the have the attributes that they were after. It's the system designer. It's just like that. But it changes the system itself. Right. Let's see a game. I need to do research here for example. But there are games that like they did balance patch like 10 times in the same character trying to like nerve it speed or it's rain for anything like that and then it just. Doesn't matter. That character still was OP like, overpowered. So it still stayed the same right as to was broken so. It was not about editing it, but maybe like after they added some characters that would. Be strong against it or like they change it. Defense mechanic Daniel Perry is the way A or B. So then, like the player itself, change it. I probably should research some Mmos examples as well. From stuff that brought inflation or made users play too much against one type of bus or stop, like doing some. Strategies that were not fun, like I definitely need to research, but that that's the way to go right for me would be giving examples of gaming. And probably teaching life services and how. To do these systems architectures to change behaviors and giving examples of stuff that. Designers try to change and then didn't change anything because they didn't actually. Change the value function. And at the same time. Examples that were successful and like how to enter this mindset of the designer itself

## Session 3: Security, Favelas & The Need for Both Solutions (2025-12-02)
Nice. One other topic that we should talk about is about. Security. The fight against it in Brazil. It will probably need some context for the international viewers, but it's it's super interesting because it's something that's evolving over time and that's always a debate and no clear solution. But it can definitely be seen. In the objects of the framework that we just did OK so. Well, let's start with like OK. So the favelas, right the, the. Excluded from society place where a lot of poor people come together to. Build the Super cheap housing with no infrastructure? No. No sewage, no like, basic needs and stuff like that. So, like, it's close to the city because that's where jobs are, that's why. Favelas appeared like they are never the bit of the feud, like they are usually big. Urban cities like where? Jobs and opportunities exist, right? So people travel there. They don't find good opportunities. They need to go to the suburbs then. Are so badly planned and so badly created, and the favelas appear. And as. There is no opportunity. It is cheaper and easier for you to earn money. And selling stuff. Or silly. And that's because no one else is willing to do those. So there's no competition and any market that doesn't have competition, it's easier to grow like. Basic capitalism, right? So. You have illicit drugs. And you have stilly. And then imagine if you are a child growing. There, right. It's hard for you to study. It's hard for you to be included in society. It's harder for you to everything like. Cardiff rich community commutes not to be rabbit and and so on and so forth and like. It's easier for you too. Earn money. By other means, right? By stealing or helping like selling drugs and so forth, right so. So. You agree that like? You may. Lock up in prison some drug dealer, but then anyone will appear because you just removed competition. So. So yeah, and and over time. This so so but but at the same time if you don't like, you could say that if locking people in prison like arresting people would be like fighting against the symptom, right? Oh, because the since the system is the same. Just the next drug dealer will appear and will be always like that, but at the same time. When you like fighting the system has it uses because it helps progress. Of the time compounding effect. So 'cause if you don't fight the system. You could say that the king. Drugs would be so profitable. That the person who sold drugs don't want to sell anymore. And because like, they want to do the cool stuff and they are afraid of being caught. By the police. So they start trying to. Clean their money. By buying some legal businesses that could be in the Gray area are finding some other way to like cleaning their own money. And once they've cleaned their own money, like they wouldn't stop. The attachments with the drug dealing so they they will still. On that. But at the same time now they are doing the clean stuff, so they are growing the clean stuff and they are probably better. Than the ones that only do the clean stuff because they are. Able to do the clean stuff and The Dirty work as well, because like they sold drugs and did. Robbery and violence before. So why don't they keep doing that? And that's how like mafias are born, right? Mafia's are. Like the gangs and like they're just different names for the same thing, right? You have now this groups that have a lot of legal stuff, so it's harder. Kind of impossible for you right now to, like, arrest everyone because they. As time goes by, they get more money and more influence and then they probably want to get into politics so that they can protect themselves by having good, good connections. And so now they do like everything right from the legal stuff to the illegal stuff. And they are like really big and a big problem that will probably. Exist for generations and super hard to to remember right so. But it if they never reach that point then probably would be harder for them to reach if you hop down. Their progress. So working with the symptoms is never the solution because it's will be A never ending problem but it can buy you time so. That's kind of more or less like why you need to do both, right? You need to figure out like how you change the system so that's not more lucrative for you to sell drugs than to go to school. As a kid. In the favela. And at the same time you need to like selling drugs. Selling drugs, it's just stop, right? So. So yeah, you can say the same for for for A game, right. So. If if hacking a game is the only way for you to win, like you need to stop the hackers. But everyone who fights against knows that like hackers will hack, right? So you, you. You won't win, I guess that, but it's super hard. It may be easier. Like you can't do it because like we would, we can say that computer science. Is more protectable than like the real world cause control more of the variables, but at the same time it's a good proxy, right? It's hard for you to fix hacking, So what you do, you try to create different incentives like. It's not that great for you to hack any more. So like a solution for not getting parted from some games in Brazil was just like let's lower the prices and. By lowering the prices, the hackers stop it, right? Or like you have so many stories about like that. Like you didn't. Fights the hacking community, but you kind of OK. You hack, but you hack discontrolled. Way. Right. And you have to do like both, right? You have to do. The systemic solution and the. More immediate one because long term and short term needs to be work together.

## Session 2: Time, Oscillation & The Cheetah (2025-12-24)
Cool. I don't know why. I don't know how it correlates with what we are doing. Like that's this is another session right now and has been some weeks since last written here so. Let's just add the SID and help me see if there's things for us to correlate. Here I was thinking about like how time compounds and. When as time compounds, right? The value function like it, it may change right? So if it doesn't change, you would argue. The things get more exponential. Overtime because is it compounding and compounding? You could say that things get a bit more and more and more extreme. Right, but at the same time as. Things are. Getting more extreme the. There might some be some forces to. Makes like the function oscillate, right? So what was presented as? Worthy and desirable. Becomes the norm and then what was the norm 'cause becomes what's desirable, right? So you you you have like the shift, so. That, that, that more or less two types. Of curves that happens with disiterations that like the. Some systems they have this synide aspect on them like 'cause they go back and forth like that's some obvious examples from fashion. That you could have you could see also behavior trends. In terms of. Sex and relationships like some generations more open to it, more some other generations more close to it and and it's back and forth tends to happen between parents and son and sons, right, 'cause they tend to to do the opposite, like of what they were not allowed to do. So there can be some. Different ways that time compounds because as yes it does compound like this EHR as directions go by and it can get more and more and more extreme but as it grows. It also changes the environment itself and as it changes the environment. If nothing ever changes. The value function never changes, so so the error and the results only compound and become more extreme. So the cheetah will only get faster and. And as they are too much specialized right now, the cheetah. It it it needs to cool down and has no way to protect itself like. While on cool down, so right now hyenas, they still the cheetah meet. Right, so the cheetahs are losing to hyenas. And this happened because they got too extreme. So one would say that over time, cheetahs will need to handle not only being faster, but at the same time handling how to hold their own. Food, so they they go a bit more social or wherever, but what I mean here is that value function will change as well and as it changes that that's one of the car reasons that. Not every single thing is just more and more and more extreme. I would say that that's one of the mindsets. Like we could tie this in the book in the sense that. When we say in the world something compounding in a way that we don't think is healthy for the world than. We should see how the environment's changing naturally and the other forces that could edit it, like maybe that could be a way to correlate and we probably need a bit a few more good examples of like how. The system's got a approach which is are there. There's like stable environments. Within limits, we could say weather. It could be one like from the ice ages to like warm ages and so forth. Could be a good example of that. So yeah, like that. That's one of the courages.

## Session 2 (Cont): Structuring the Book (2025-12-24)
I want you to help me draft some. Chapter names are like structure so that I can better see like how is the book shaping up? So maybe create a file? That has like. Chapter names and one. Small paragraph for some bullet points about, like what would the charter be? And let's think of. Few alternatives are two or three ways we could do these chapters. This way I can see like how the book would be shaping up in a macro level. And see if we need more ideas and more examples and think like how, how, how does it feel overall.

I want you to help me think about those options. As you can see we have some personas in the personas folder. I want to. Impersonate them. Role plays them. And then tell me each persona, what would they feel? For each of the structures, propose it.

I love your persona feedbacks. I think that's encapsulates well the things before the fining. Let's create one more seed here. It's probably not a seed that we use as book content, but as something for us to be aware of. Let's write some game design. Good practice, right? Because as we are looking at the Slams as a game designer for the world. You think it's only fair to use Gamezide for the book itself as well, right? So. Two things here one. The hook. So I think it's a car idea for any game designer that we need to hook. Users instantly, right? So we have to do the same here I. Do agree that C, the option C has a better hook. I'm not sure if why everything feels extreme is the correct way to do it because it's click click, betty, Betty and it feels. A bit like. Not extreme, but arrogant in the sense that we know everything, right? So we need to do a hook and to make the US. Few and get like what, what and why we're talking about. But las in a sense less with the feeling of I know all right it it needs to be more of OK we should be taking we should look the world in a different lands. That's the car purple, the proposal right for this book here, for us to avoid the traps of the daily discussions and take a step back and look at the systems as a whole, like that's a car proposed. Here, so probably the hook could be something. Along the lines. Of Do you feel, do you think everything's more extreme now or like how things are get getting extreme? Every year. Something like that, right? And also for game design. So OK we've done, we've thought about hook, we should think about car loop. So yeah, the each chapter should have like its own. Car loop right? It should be. And with a payoff and. And match well with the next chapter. So we have like this smaller cycles of car loop and that's the bigger cycle that. Fits well with stuff, right? So that's another thing that we should be thinking and if you could, I would love for you to. Ask me about when are tumor games like principles the? Are common for system design and then I can write down. Why and how they should fit with the book?

I love both of your ideas. Let's add both to the meta script here. So far onboarding I do, I do agree with you about letting. One thing at a time, but I also love that you said Metroid final because as you can see in Metroid Vanya we start actually usually we start with like all the powers and then we last lose out and then we start gaining each and this is usually done to like for the hook, right, so that you know where you are going to get into. So if we just tell one part of the question at a time. What will happen is that people will start wondering like, wait, where are we getting to right? So. That's more or less like. We don't need to Add all the concepts on the first chapter like definitely shouldn't, because if we do it, it will be overwhelming. But the first chapter should. Deliver some. So that the user has an idea of where we are going into. But not too deep, so it's not overwhelming and then yes, we do progress and add one stack at a time until we reach like thesis, right. And also about the balancing and pacing, totally agree with you, we need like more. Some areas where we do a lot of examples when some areas that are marked oracle and more. Algorithmic. Or metaphorical. And so yeah, we we we should flow between. Dance areas and slower racing areas for the book so that user has this rest. Place to be right. So totally agree with you about. Balancing and and we can think about the start telling examples. And deep dives into. Some data. Write those down and then I have some ideas about this.

I'm thinking for the chapters to be more granular like so I have more chapters, make them smaller. And. And have some back and forth. So like maybe we could start with the hook. And the hook shouldn't be arrogant, so it should be something like a question like do you feel how the world getting more extreme? And from there. Shows examples. And then probably finish that small cap chapter and hook with. A small glimpse of. How and why I see those examples reached there like that so small glimpse about the? Iterations and optimizations, but super simple. And then styling like something around lines of in the next captures and along this book we'll. Show ways for us to view how things got where we are and what are the driving forces for this to happen so that we may allow the user to. Have their own framework. Better can use to dive deeper into any of the subjects that may matter for them. And bring better options to the table. Then on like the following chapters, what we could do is like. Take one car concept of our. Thesis for another equation and like that. That's the main topic. And then we have like two or three like sub chapters. We could call chapters like sections and chapters and hierarchy here, but so at first we do the theory, the theory, then we do like 2 or 3 small chapters deep diving into an example. And going. Deeper into each of them, like doesn't just mention, but actually do almost like a Fukai chapter on the example itself. So it's more. My human base is my start startelli bases and last concepts. But like showing where the concepts that the user already the reader actually the reader already knows like where those concepts are in set example. And then we do we finish like this three small chapters with one chapter that like brings together the the whole knowledge that the user has right now. So like it condenses what we've already teach it for. This chapter and also like the previous ones like how these all all tied together and the main question that those bring. Because doesn't doesn't these questions will. Some of them activists will be so weird or explained on the next chapters. When we add more concepts in the book, right, so we we kind of have this structure of. Theory example example. Conclusion and conclusion opening questions for the next section to happen, so it works as a hook

Could you check now how the personas would react to this chapter structure and compare with the previous UH proposals as well?

Good to see that the personas feedbacks seem better and I do agree. Like reading the files about the cap chap chapters I think. It looks like it has a good pacing and I like where each example fits Ingeon. But before writing, start writing down anything. Just let's do some last. Minute checks here. First, do you think in a chapter here is to dance? It might not have the best. Example. Or do you think that there's something missing here? It feels rounded and oh, it's OK but. One last check would be good. And also I would love to see some estimates here on like. Pages and book size if we go with this content. How much time will be on as a notebook or how many pages will it has? Like per chapter or as a book as a whole just to have AA, good feeling? Around where we are going to.

Could you research for me typical book sizes for? Bestsellers. Even my references books. Are they bigger than what we are creating here? Are are they smaller like? Would love to have like some references on that. Just to have a better overview

I would love to aim for a bit bigger. We don't need sapiens size. But and probably being a bit smaller than atomics habits. Could be good so like 6000. Could be a good aim so. More or less a double of what we are aiming, I'm just not sure if it. It should be like bigger chapters or more chapters. Looking at the searcher right now, if you if you get sound so. Maybe we should just have that in mind. Not change anything right now, just write down that. I believe a bit bigger would be better. And as we write, we might get more ideas. And then that does could explain and just fine. The bigger size just because if it's true small is also too shallow, right? And if it and I'm not looking into it to be like this. But then she started lines and and wherever like I went, I went to be deep enough so the. It is convincing enough it looks. More fatful, it gives more time for the user to. Few and understand what I'm saying. Because I think that it has a good important message, right? So, so yeah, probably a bit bigger for the aim itself, but we could. Work in it either from the words and like bigger chapters are more content. I think I'm feeling that the last part here the conclusion. Might not be good like we don't have a recap or. An overview like. We just keep adding more and more stuff, and maybe also we don't. Dive deep enough into the tools about how to think better, because then what I would like people to do is like. If they agree. With the book. Or at least that the book itself could change a bit how people view. The world and the systems and help them dive into their own agendas, right? So be it. Something macro as politics. Politics be it something as micro as. And all the relationship are like their own work day or whatever, right? So how like to apply and think about those. So maybe have some examples or thinking. I'm not here to suggest solutions for any of those big systems because they're not the expert on any of those, but definitely. Dandenong. Needs to have. A good enough pacing.

I think we can go back and forth. So we can improve the toolkit later and. So yeah, but but we definitely should start doing the manuscript as it will give us a feeling of how things are going. But I will need your help to start doing it right. So. Let's create one file per chapter. Umm. Let's. Daidius. That we want for that chapter. I think as we are doing this step down approach. About structure for the book, I think we should do the same for the Mancrit itself, so like inside the manuscript. Instead of just writing down centers by centers, we could. Do that about like starting to blend the block and then from the block we rewrite it and delete and rewrite and delete it so it becomes the the chapter itself. So. Let's dive into part one. Plus part two like grade. These five files. With some small blocks when done. Create another file about this meta part like how we want to. Work on the manuscript as I suggested so that future AI agents know. Like what's the process here? OK. But yeah, let's create these five files and let's start some blocking. About the structure of each of these chapters, and in the end I want to be like it will be all written by me as a human. But definitely will help to have your structure ended in it, at least far like the. First chapters are examples, or at least to give give me like AA, start in the sense that they can. Keep moving and feel like where we're going on. And yeah, we're like, you know. How I tend to stock. And I want the. Written texts to feel that way. As I also wish to have a good audio book some points in the future, so definitely if it's written in a way that's good to read. It's gonna be good. And it's gonna be feeling, it's gonna feel like me, right? So, so yeah and let's start doing some blocking here. So I went to your suggestion unblocking and from there II, I'll discuss with you.

Let's keep on the blocks OK. I will probably do the drafts myself. I ask for you to do it part by part, but I want to review the blocks at least. So you didn't follow your chapters fairly well, right? The file is the Red Queen. And on your master outline, it wasn't, so you kind of change it it. A bit. And I'm not sure I'm feeling super well on the chapter. Actually, I'm not sure if I'm feeling well. How. Each example is being handled because it's. It doesn't feel much as a deep dive. Like check the virus one here. How does the dumb thing beat the smart thing? Should that really beat the hook? The question at least like. Is it? Is this the lesson? I think not, right? If you're, I would like, whenever you are suggesting those blocks for you to read the seeds file again before writing them. So you have. A reminder of like how I explained stuff. We also have the raw transcripts file. That I hope that you are editing and adding the raw transcripts for everything that we are discussing today as well. But from those you could see that the angle that I'm looking into, the various topic and other topics that would be in the chapter four are a bit different from what you were suggesting

## Session 2: Structure & Consistency (2025-12-24)
It is just polemic. translate the headline to english. im not happy with the start of the draft. but I think we can halt that. lets add some visual for part i / part ii on the .md file. check this, it all have the same visual hierarchy. And will this translate well to google docs later? nice! Now, can we write down part 3 blocks as well? no no, lets complete all parts as well, so I can "See" the whole book. are you hallucinating? the part name and chapters names dont match the master_outiline. good. I want you to double check now for consistency. yes please. there are still some wrong files! commit all this with the script please. why vscode terminal is not running? can we log this session? all raw transcriptions and other things we routinelly do?

## Session 3: Deepening & Seed Audit (2025-12-25)
I would love for you to... add the 'Traffic' (emergent behavior) and 'LEGO' (building blocks) metaphors into Chapter 15.

---

## Session 4: Reviewing Part II & III Structure (2025-12-26)
Hello. Read my project workspace so that you'll have context on what we're doing. We're writing a book here, so read like Agent's notes. Umm, some scripts. And like, what are the patterns that we're doing here? Right. So we're the gardener, we're doing front seats to manuscripts, we have personas that were appraisals and all of that. And we have a process of review where after we've created a manuscript, I tend to read it and write down some reviews before I actually editing stuff. I want you to check all of this. Cool. And then. Tell me like if you did it and then we'll start a review process

Good. Actually I'm reading the PDF. In another page. So that's why like I'm only looking at dexamere OK TRA. So let's keep reviewing, so log the raw transcript. And create this other review page. Cool. Just as a reminder, end of chapter 8. It's a bit strange to finish talking about the future if we have a chapter. That's not about that. Following this one OK. So chapter 8 on part two like. It's a good chapter to talk about letters. But doesn't end well and we'll need to figure the finish the ending of it a little bit better later OK. On Chapter 9, I don't like. That will list stuff in the same paragraph. I would do the bullet points with each in it. It's on paragraphs. So each different for a system to learn to retire an error. Brake light, one population duration where environment shapes blah blah blah, chew. Driver iteration. Virtual pleasure tree, right. OK. So everybody's point. It's online. I think it's way better than just one huge paragraph. Also I do think that. Here Chapter 9 as it's the end of the chapter. They depart at the end of the part and it's like all the conclusions. I think it's a good place for us to have like the formula. Shown, at least for what we have right now, OK so. Talking about iteration times variation, that's the power of adaptation and. And then a reminder that what's the iteration is. Iteration usually is. Usually it's an action with some form of concrete feedback. And. So some reminders of stuff that are not iterations. So like if we some actions that you can take that you don't have a feedback. Be there immediate or ever. I think if you have two or three quick examples there as reminders. 'cause we we are trying to remind and teach like 0 this is how you spot iteration, this is how you spot variation like this is the formula OK. So I think it's good to. Talk about that again. I don't agree with the paragraph about. This explains the speed of the modern world. It explains why eyes off in weeks, why startups are failing fast, and so forth. I think. We can't go there. But the paragraph that comes before don't explain this at all. OK. I think that we need something. To come for it, right? So I think it's OK to have this sentence like we want to talk about the speed of the modern world since it ties back to the 1st paragraph, 1st chapter of all. So and I think it's always good like to to tie back stuff so that. We as an reader like. Gets a sense of OK we are understanding a bit better. Stiff, so I think it's good, but far as she'll explain this speed. We we should have some sentences before talking about. The iteration's so talking about like how social media has quick cycles, so. We have information as faster than ever and because of that we got way more feedback. I feel like an action that's good or bad and all that. So something along those lines. To explain the speed the speed OK. So like I like. I like the paragraph about thinking of a modern smartphone. About the thousands of engineers with internal iteration the rivalry. Iteration, I point Samsung. And and yeah, like, I like all this paragraph. It's just that you did the conclusion before it. And. Then you do it wrong again like. There's this whole section that I don't want to have in this chapter at all, which is, but there is a massive piece of bosom missing. The engine explodes. Change. But doesn't explain direction. I don't love it. III know that. I know that we need to have some form of bridge, but strange for still strange for me like the end of a part. Should have a huge payoff. A huge Erika are like, oh, now I got it. Like that's the end of part two. Now I get it. And you did a bridge again because you're talking more about. How the value function shows direction? Like that's not to be here. OK. That's not to be here being extra clear to you. We should talk about that on the next part, Part 3. We should do it and on part three. I think the part three should start with. The sentence. Of there's a massive piece of the puzzle missing. I think it's better to be there. To talk about the engine explains change, but doesn't explain direction and it's not about being better and so forth. And as I mentioned, we don't need to call this value function yet. Because yes, definitely we should call this selection. And as I mentioned in the previous. Transcript. I want to slowly go to value function so. The invisible judge. This chapter here it's car for the theory OK. So we want to bring the theory together. For the purpose of this chapter, this part right? So right down we need to write down somewhere like the watch. Each part of the book is strange accomplish. Part 12 is introduction is like the coach action. So it's it's trying to. Bring the reader to the mindset. So. Tell that I'm not an expert tell. Try to connect with the user reader talking about how the word feels. Heavier right now and then give an example of a like how we should take a look at stuff from the salesman's perspective left. I think Part 1's perfect and that's kind of the like it wants to bring the user to the correct, the reader to the correct mindset. Then Part 2 we want to show the framework and at least the base of it, so and show like how it is everywhere. From. Populations true living things to non living things internally and externally as well. So like show all of those right? Because we want to teach the reader to spot the pattern. And to understand it then on part three. We want to explain the future. We want to explain. To selection that this is not evil, it's just the fittest. And explain how the selection like the value function itself. Defines purpose, defines behavior. And like. How? In the end, that's the thing that most matter. Of all like the duration and variance like the just how they work. And it's good to understand and spot them so that we can speed stuff and like control it a bit, but in the end like. Stuff optimize should. Value function to the selection. So like that's the most important things to see like what's the value function here? So that's more or less the. The the goal for this part is to. Explain how. This filter effects behavior and affects the outcomes. Of things. Cool. So given that. And given that we defined a structure on each part, we start with the theory, then we go deeper into examples, and then we finish with a payoff like. Making it all come together. In chapter 10, which is the Invisible Judge, the first chapter for part three. It should. We had bad de Turi OK so. It's here that we start talking about OK. We talk about the engine, but it doesn't give direction and so on all of that and then explain. That's not about being good or bad or evil, it's just about being fittest and talk about selection. And to talk about selection we should bring the examples that were already mentioned in previous chapters. The giraffe. It's OK to say we don't need to take say too much about the giraffe and. But the virus is a good one like why? Why it's contagious and not killing like II love the questions that you did in the previous version, the finger deleted, you deleted the, the the questions like why does the. The virus became more contagious and not more. And not more little. I think it's super good. Just tie that. Why is the salesman? More like. Why does the salesman explain and talk smart and his better his communications instead of? I don't know. Being better and selling the right thing for the right person and like. Being super sincere and truthful to everyone. Why? It's one behavior against the other, like showing examples from things that we've talked in the past and talking about like how? Why one thing was selected are none and not the other like this selection giving all of those examples a selection and then go to the value function like describing and explaining what value function is. Just because that's the mathematical part and that's the Super important thing. So like. We call this filter the value function and then OK and then giving this quick examples that you've written down already about the IMDB, the movies, the value function being like this car got in a test and the GPA and stuff like that. I think, yeah, I think that's more or less it. And the idea here. Is your clothes like this chapter? Talking about getting here, being clear about the judge and how important it is to understand what is being judged truly and what not? Because this will usually explain the end behavior. OK. That's the the goal for this chapter. I will have more things to say, but write those feedbacks down. Remember, we're just doing a review, so we're not editing the manuscripts or anything like that yet. You are writing down the feedback and noting this raw transcript as well, saving it for later use

## Session 5: Part III Deep Dive - AI, Markets, and Exams (2025-12-26)
Good. Now back to reviewing OK. So ever had talked about the Chapter 10 and how we need to change it? So I won't go over that again because we didn't have time to edit it already. It's all written down in the last review. So going now to the following chapters. Let's see. OK So training AI. It's something that we need to be super, super. Did that took right? Because it? Because it is a hot start pixel, probably a lot of people kind of understand stuff, but at some time we need to be extra sure, so most people don't know that training AI, select starting from. Simple neurons and then doing some random mathematics and then applying machine learning. So we'll need to teach that. We either show that and teach that in the parts too. Where we are talking about iteration and variation. I think we can show it there. Some place not as a main focus of a chapter. But it would fit to explain the process there. And then let's Chapter 11 use this knowledge that was. Glossed over or briefly briefly explained before. To talk about value function, yeah, maybe. Let's see if it's food similar in the latest park or if it should be here. But if it's either way, it needs to be somewhere. OK just because the way it's written right now. It's a bit out of the blue. Like, oh, I would give Randall noise. Like, why? User Waskda, right? Like why you're giving random noise. And then we introduced a judge like, it's a bit confusing. And also like then we introduce the judge. We define the value function, a mathematical rule that give the computer a high score when it gets closer to a goal and a penalty when it moves away. Didn't we just explain that? In the last chapter, like shouldn't we say like? Then we introduce the judge, a scarring system that makes the AI do what we want. So. If Sir read had read handwritten numbers, it will give points when you practically guess the handwritten and and so forth like. I think it's better. Instead of like explaining again that value function is giving points for something and Pennsylvania like II think it's good to give three or four examples like oh so. We appraised when you correct and get the correct number or if you've got the correct animal. Or in an LLM like in the sense that when the word chosen is like they are correctly predicts the best words. Like are the text that will be written by. Alter or like in the latest AI models like. The AI. We give it's a point if it gets correct answer. Different fields like mathematics and so far flux. So yeah I think it's good to go in some of those like just just say like OK. This is a judge the value function. And then yeah. I don't like how it's written. This AI chapter. It is kind of like a saw, like a. The way it's written doesn't feel interesting. It it it lags like the punchy questions like. After we explain the value function if in question, say some stuff like. Can you see? How a simple? Change in math equation unlike what we are evaluating. Changes the Foo AI behavior. I think this kind of questions in the middle of that paragraphs are in the middle of the chapter are good ways to punctuate what we want the reader to feel or to understand, and I think this will give way more emotion. Yeah, so like we've gave some examples and after giving them. Let's do the epiphany here. Like why did I give all of those so because here check it out. Just by changing this we change it so much. And then we can go back to the examples and like showing how powerful this is so. Just by doing this definition, we were able to, like, correctly define digits OK. That's cool, but then, oh, check how we correctly define. Engagement time and like holy **** now have social media or. Look how we correctly made LLMS that are good now in mathematics or they can now. Able to mimic an outer style. So. Show like the power. Show like the power and like the whole change. Here is just the value function. I think that's. The way that this feels cool. And then yeah, talking about like the burning of the algorithm is not evil, it's just doing what the judge rewarded it for. Like I think this is super good. It's also repeating that AI doesn't have consciousness, but it's super good example to see how. This value function shapes it all. So yeah, I think that's the point. And if more or less got it, but the chapter itself, like, yeah, yeah, we need to rewrite it. Then going to the next chapter. I don't love. The Baker's examples in the sense of talking about the lazy. And the perfectionist stands low. I don't love like the first paragraph here about the Bakers. I think we could do something a little bit different that doesn't have like all of this. Judge of Carter. I think it's more about talking about like. All the first Baker. Do sales expensive and bad tasted and the other one sells tons of and super cheap and and gives some examples. That direction. Like, oh, so I don't know. Some bakers sell only sell bread that's like so huge that only 10 people can eat it. And the other one just sell like small portions for people or wherever, like giving this variance of bread selling and then yeah and then I go we go to, we say that OK at some point the town ends up with good bread and all that. And yes, then talking about Adam Smith and the invisible hand, you think that's awesome. I agree with talking about which paker is the winner. I think it's important to say that one, just one single Baker will win, but that it will converge. And I think it's also interesting to say like. Different cities may have different pakers that would wing, so we kind of end up like. With one type of bakers in Italy, another type of baking in Paris, United States, and in Brazil. Because like what? The townsfolk there are searching for is different, so it's kind of like always. What is being? What's the future? What's the value function in itself? I think that's the beginning of the chapter. So it's like what you said, but I think the way I just did it, I think it's. Better for the reader to attach and understand the point here. 'cause again, we are just talking about we are bringing the concept from nothing Smith to our system. And reminding how different value functions bring. Different. Results and metrics, right, so that I think that's kind of. The beginning here. The part here about capitalism and socialism? I'm thinking about it if it fits well in this chapter or if it should be in the time compounding effect. Cause yes, it does change the judge. So, and by changing the judge it changes behavior and I think it's super interesting to point those out. But maybe like? Who won between capitalism and socialism? At least in the Cold War, it's more in the compounding effect. So. 'cause like in the short term. Socialism seem to work, but then it lost. 'cause it was bringing more and more issues right? And also we could use one of our references from My Nation's fails when they explain about socialism. Extractive and inclusive. Institutions, I think super good to use that reference, but maybe it's about timing. It's it fits better in the parts 4 when we're talking about code compounding effects of timing time here we want to talk about the value functions and how they shape stuff. So I think it's useful to. Capitalism and socialism to talk about life out there. Trying to iterate and change value functions and iterate over different stuff. And if we can talk mostly about like the short term behavior, I think it's better. I think it's in this chapter it would be good to talk about, like when the invisible hand doesn't work. Just like point as like not all value functions are always working. A like a value function is not global or universal, right? So thinking that the invisible hand is the only thing that's at play can be some can be naive and dangerous. So I would go more. Pinch your debt so. Talking about like. Monopolies. Are. Government interference like. Not if it not as an evil thing. Again, just like I'll have country and AA and country B doing stuff. And OK if you just let the invisible hand work. Maybe one country ends up with all the wealth, another not or something like that. So like we have the. Different views from the government and population so. What people value will be a bit different. So I'm not sure we need to think about this chapter because it's hard one and there are a lot of topics that we could be talking so. Yeah, no clear solution here, but I think. I think it's easier to spot what's not with what shouldn't be here. I like the blind spot of the judge. I liked the first paragraph about the herbal builder and the tools and the profits at some limit. I think it's good to talk about the consequences of having the profits. And I and I like comparing with the dumbbell AI that's just over optimized for something. Not sure about this chapter. Uh yeah, we need to think more about it. The next chapter, the. Exam trap. I like the beginning like. Comparing this to schools, but the next paragraph I think still rush it like. The exam factor gets the highest cars in the country, they get the best universities and then the parents flock to disease and factory. I think we need to. Be a bit slower here like. OK. So yeah, the exam factory makes gets the students to this best choose this better university. And then. And then you should think as a parent would you pay your son or daughter in the school where we have higher chances of better universities or to the other so? As an individual, the parents choosing pays it on university. Chance and because of that. Overtime the schools will be selected to be more more like the exam factory and are not like the Academy of Life. Cool II think this. Thought process for the parents is something that's missing here and it's important for us to capture and again always remember like how I'm talking because we want this book to be as close as possible on how I do it, like. How I write stuff or say stuff? Not sure we need to say like it's one of the most powerful examples of how the value function can reshape an entire generation. It's not reshaping that one generation. Because it's been here through centuries, right? Like these exams and universities, it's actually a process of it's more on compounding time part for the next chapter, but. So the way I would say here is less, oh, the most powerful examples. Yeah, like I don't like those sentences. You know that. And it's more like 0. This is the exam prep. It may be cautious or unconscious for people or society as a whole. But just because as an individual level, we. Focus on choosing the. Option that gives better universities at a macro level. The schools, they will all kind of just do. Net. And I think we can also like points like an extra paragraph here and just like to tie with the last chapter talking about. If we talk about individuals. And if it let this alone, like schools, will be just that, just as the market will just focus on profit. And that's can be like one of the. Rules of the government and law and all of that to try to focus on other. Optimizations so like 0 if you want more Academy of lives, we need as lawmakers or. And all that I like to think how can we change the value function and create this other. Rules. So like how can we fight? This how can we shape it at all right so yeah, so we have external forces and players working on here. You can. Mention the. Later we'll discuss like what's more useful and more powerful. Like what's fighting again against the river and what's actually changing the value function, but just that, like if we just let individuals alone, like this would clearly be one of the key things here. So, but yeah, we have different players and I think it's good to have that. I love the conclusion about the metrics, the message. I love the paragraph about emergent behavior. About not teaching people children, like, about managing their bank account, I think that's super. Super good. They lit pivot. Yeah, I I've talked about that and I think we need to. Because it's a hard topic to say. So yeah, definitely. Need to think lot how to expect it. I think it's well written, I'm just not sure if it should be here. Or if it should be. On the compounding time. Because it's good, no? I think it should be here. Later we will mention it because definitely that's. That's a new. Newvalue function that appears later, right? So it. It's a consequence of the compounding of time. But yeah, yeah, I think it's it's fine to be here. It makes sense. And then later we explain like why it's appeared. That said, I don't agree with paragraphs like 0. This greatest strange culture divide. The working class remains rapid in the exam factory. Uh, optimizing for the old metric where the other bike. II think that's a bit too much? Medlis here in Brazil, where I can clearly see the pattern, at least for now. I wouldn't say that the richest are only focusing on this new factor, like it's something that's emerging, but it's not that. The old one, it's dead OK. So I wouldn't, yeah, I don't want to say that. But I find it interesting that it's important to point this like OK. So so then we create this new. Action are like this. New behavior and way of thought and and and yeah. It is real with time, creates a cultural divide between. Type of schools and and yeah, the rich and poor and so forth. But. Nothing as wrong as. You've written here. And then again, I always finish chapters with some. Good paragraph, like punchy paragraph. Write down as a reference. Not a reference in the terms of the knowledge, but reference writing style. Write down about random. Maybe get some quotes from him as well. Would be good. Like Renault, Sanderson always ends each his chapters with some punchy sentences or paragraphs and stuff like that. I think that's kind of what I'm trying to say here. So OK we finish it the exam trap. We should do some paragraphs talking about. How stuff optimize? For exams. But because stuff optimizes for that now we have this emergent behavior as well. So we have two different optimizations happening, so. How important it is to look? At the value function to explain. What are the players in long term? It's always essential to remember that we have this natural variance because there will always be a new director of a new school that will try a different thing because that's how he or she believes education should be. But the pattern. Through time, we'll select successor failure between all of these different features that are trying to do different. Ways to teach.

## Session 4: Review of Part II & The "Bridge" Problem (2025-12-26)
I think we should both stop doing filters to stop doing bridges. I find it a bit meta and strange. We're writing for the end user, not for ourselves. It's always better to end the chapter with some realization.

Chapter 9... should be more and more and more interesting, like for the payoff. Repeating what was causing the variations and maybe jacking a few more quick examples.

The AI chapter is super cool. It's the purest way possible to show how a valuation shapes behavior. No neurons, just math and a goal.

Take the bridge chapter from last part, bring it to this one here. Explain and show that the judge is not evil, it is just a filter. Use the Savanna example. The Savanna doesn't hate the short-necked giraffe. It's just a filter.

The "Winner" is not the "Best." The "Winner" is simply the one who fits the current Value Function most perfectly. The Judge is indifferent. It doesn't care about your intentions, your hard work, or your potential. It only cares about the fit.

---

## Session 5: Part III Deep Dive & Standalone Chapters (2025-12-26)
The first chapter of Part 3 starts with the wrong chapter name. It's called Chapter 8 The Invisible Judge. But Part 2 ended with Chapter 9. We need a smart way to keep those chapter numbers correct.

Chapters should be standalone scenes. If the first paragraph of one chapter is only understandable by reading the last paragraph of the last chapter, that's bad. People stop and start reading. Each chapter should work start to finish alone.

The "track" metaphor for Value Function is slightly off. The track is the rules/guidelines. The Value Function is what defines the winner (like the laps or the score).

The AI training explanation needs to be better. We train AI by creating a dump computer that does random stuff, then we define a value function and reward it. This makes it do vastly different things (reading handwriting, recognizing images, becoming LLMs). AI is the best way to show how valuation shapes behavior because it's just math and a goal.

Part 3 structure:
1. Theory (The Invisible Judge) - Explain selection, then introduce Value Function. Use Savanna example. Use IMDB, GPA, Metacritic examples.
2. AI (The Algorithm's Brain) - Purest example of behavior shaping.
3. Capitalism vs Socialism (The Invisible Hand) - Its own chapter.
4. The Exam Trap - Real-world application of the concept.

The Judge is not evil, it's just a filter. The problem is narrow value functions. We should use examples from the first chapter (headlines) and show the value functions behind them. No bridges at the end.

## Session 8: Part IV Refactor & Breakpoints (2025-12-28)
One new concept that I think it was useful to add. Into this part form in beats own chapter it's about. Braking changes so continuous. Evolution and breaking changes. So like the idea that. Not all 2% increases are the same. So like if you think about an RPG game. And you have like 10 damage and the enemy has 30 HP. So you need three hits to kill it. If you increase your damage to 13. You still need three hits to kill it. So it's a 30% increase in damage, but it's a 0% increase in efficiency. But then if you increase to 16. Suddenly you need only two hits to kill it. So this one increase that was the same as the previous one. Suddenly changed the amount of hits and optimized it. So like this idea of breakpoints. And thresholds. I think it's super cool to talk about it. And we can use the electricity. Example that we are removing from the compound effects chapter to another chapter after it. To talk about like this invisible cliffs. That we are optimizing and optimizing and optimizing and everything seems fine. Until suddenly it's not. Because we've reached a threshold. And the system breaks. I think that's a cool chapter to have. So yeah, please add the seeds and do the edits that were mentioned here.

Are you remembering to save all the transcripts from our conversations? And I'm not sure I found where did you. Add it like we didn't add the new chapter that I asked you for. After the compound effect.

## Session 4: Review of Part II & The Bridge Problem (2025-12-26)
Cool. Now let's begin our review pattern. So should not remind. Remember, check how reviews should be written down. But it's more in the focus of A review than actually doing the edits. So just taking notes OK. I will do this big transcript. Make sure to save it and all that. I find it a bit odd that the end of chapter 8. We do this. Bridge of like to answer that we have just step out of the engine and look at the track. We have to look at the future like we're doing which many bridges, not sure II don't love ending chapters on them. I think we should reconsider doing that and also it's strange because. We end on that, but then we don't go to the future in the next chapter, so. I think we should both stop doing filters to stop doing bridges. Sorry, by the end of chapters. I think it's always better to end the chapter. With some realization. That end it with some form of bridge for the next chapter. I find a bit meta and strange. At the beginning of chapter nine, has a bullet point with number four. I understand that's following the chapter 8, but not not even the same style. It is also like a. Number out of the blue. Like it's a bit hard to follow. What is that and why is that there? And it's also a bit better the sense that the bullet point is the bridge. What? Like why we're doing, we're writing for the end user, not. For ourselves, right? So what's the bridge? And then we say closing thought and like leading part three like. What? Why? I like as the writer, I know what we're doing here. So yeah, but it feels better in the sense that it feels more for us than for the reader. And also what's a bit strange is the last chapter of part two. Is not. The conclusion of part two, but instead. The beginning of Patri. This is odd. Definitely odd. It doesn't feel good. Add on. I think the focus here should like we should always finish our a part with a chapter that. Encapsulates, encapsulates like it envelopes all the learnings for that chapter. And has a huge payoff like the reader feels smarter. Understand better. While was sad. Like we should start doing this. Bridges like you love this like and I don't know. No. Don't know why. So definitely we let you focus and change that for all our. Chapters stopping doing like this, tones of bridges. I think it's good to have a bridge, but probably like the beginning of the next chapter. Or or something more organic. Like a conclusion should feel like a payoff. So Chapter 9 which is the last chapter. Should be. More and more and more interesting, like for the payoff. If you check the chapter like less than half of it is talking about what we've learned. So like the population iteration, river iteration, eternal iteration, information iteration. And it's more about old engine. Check how COVID like why did stuff did what they did. I get it and I think it's good to have those, but not sure if it should be the last thing from the part. But I do like the text that we've added here. Just did you think if it should be the beginning of the next part? Or shove something else. But I do think we should. Go deeper here each other review. Of what was discussed so. Repeating what was causing the variations and maybe jacking a few. More quick examples of how they fit iteration variation, just so it's easier for the reader that get used to see the iteration. Spotty. It all. Let it write it down and then I'll go to next

## Session 4: Polishing and Export (2025-12-25)
Few points here. One is it needed to create the MD and HTML file before the PDF? Just to know if we would need like all three files should always exist. And second, like as I'm just looking right now, we see 93 pages, so our appraisal was way off. It was saying about like 30 pages something like that so. Definitely something for us to check out, like the appraisal script. Probably change it. And then. Yeah, like for the book, I think it's good enough right now. Maybe we should later check. The font that's being used, if that's the most common, I love that. I don't like the. The first page itself, but yeah, it's a draft, so it works.

Perfect. Now just delete all the versions because those were all for like testing the for matching and I want to keep versions. That are different in content itself, right? So this was more for debugging, not that we have a solid. Expert script just delete all and create the version one.

Perfect. Now let's just finish the session. So do the unusual procedures like write down the raw transcripts. Anything else that's required for the end of the session, like the gate sync as well and so on

Think about the incentive of a successful drug dealer... money without being used has no purpose... the system creates a new incentive: The need to clean the money. Dissect [the favela/police issue] as a system... how as times goes by... drug dealers get more and more money... need to clean this money up... becomes a mafia.

Looking for my for my Sids. Is any of the seeds not used? (in manuscript)

Now can you also check the raw manuscripts? Actually the raw transcript, sorry. Are there raw transcripts in the manuscript like the essence of them, like in each example, and the way that I tell the storytelling

## Session 4 (Cont): Review of Chapter 2 - Variance & Iteration (2025-12-25)
Let's continue the review OK. I feel like part one will need more chapters. Before really starting. The adaptation equation and the like the engine itself. Causeway III Think we need to drive? Like, why her what we are attempting to do in this book? So like we need to. Few more, less. Things are getting stream and like. While checking and understanding the system matters. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a bit out of the book. Like, out of nowhere. And like chapter two. I think we need something in chapter two. Because the paragraph itself is like. Doesn't connect like. The infinite monkey theorem like. Cool, it's good. But why the **** I'm talking about that? Not sure if I like that has the power of selection. Like. Oh, if we type infinite stuff. That will write Shakespeare. Yeah, I've heard about that. Probably a lot of people didn't that don't ever heard of that. So, like, definitely we should. Explain a bit better like that if we have random words and letters, and if if we have all the random stuff sentences ever at some point we have exactly the random letters that compound Shakespeare. Like just talking about 1 in one paragraph is not good, like it's not that we've all heard the infinite monkey theory, like this is something that some people heard. I discuss it that we need to be, we need to be mindful in this book that we will have people from different. Subjects reading it right? So people with different backgrounds. So no, not everyone read. I heard David Monkey theory so. It's agreed there and then like, what the **** if we select? This is the part of selection. It returns random chance into inevitable success. This is the engine of the world. I call it the adaptation equation. Like, holy **** this is super. Arrogant like takes like super huge steps. I definitely don't like how this is written. You need to only need to look to those variables to understand how it evolves, like a virus or top a political movement like. No, no, no, no, no. This this is bad. Like we explain iteration and variance in one paragraph each. Like this is also bad. And intelligence is speed. I also don't agree. I don't agree with this whole chapter and how it explains like. We want to be didactic here and to we are introducing what is iteration and what's variance. And that this is adaptation, right? So what we want to show here? And we'll go deeper into the chapters later, right. So, so here it's the introduction OK. So let's think about it. The last part, well, we've talked about things getting extreme. Umm, we should probably pick one of the teams that were mentioned in the previous chapters and start from there, right? So like, say. Let's say that. We. Pick the. It's hard to talk about iteration and variance equals adaptation if we don't talk about like adaptation. And then is filtered by some the environment, right. So we kind of have to explain that, but we don't want to dive too deep into the environment. So somehow we should like quickly glimpse over. The sense that. When I look into. Like the end of part one, we want to say something like, oh, let's imagine that you're looking like into a salesman. Uh. What do you usually see in the salesperson? Imagine like a real estate salesperson will be something that's charming, someone that's good with words and good at explanation. And. And all of that, right? And then you should ask like, why do you see this profile of people there, right? And. And that's a good like a easy example for us, right? For a person to imagine like, oh, you see a salesman being good to in communication and it's super charming because they. Kind of need to lure people. And to our cell, a cell right into buying whatever they want and all of that and. You could think of a person learning. From each trial and error that they tried to sell. Like they tried to sell something and they fail. Then they try to be super specific and fail. Then they try to be convincing and fail and then at some point they have a success and they learn from it and then they start. Doing it better and better. Right, so we have like. Internal. Like 11 person like change its behavior from the feedback it got. And when you think about hundreds of people trying to sell stuff. The ones that learn this pattern, they tend to be more successful. So they would teach more people. About that. And like our people will have. The streets and yeah, but it's not a conspiracy because it's not that every single sales person in the world for like from the United States to Brazil to Japan or China or. Decided that now they need to be that way. Like you could see sales persons you can hear you hear stories from like sales people from like medieval times where like. There were no good ways to communicate between countries and like our continents that they would try to bargain, right? So like behaviors. For way different places tended to have like similar approaches and all that and why this happened? Like it's because. The environment shaped them. Cool. And and I think that's a good explanation. It's good to like it doesn't need to be super specific right now in the sense that explanation here. Like we want people to get the feeling of what I'm trying to say. So they want to hear a better explanation OK. And then we start chapter two and the chapter two. Here it should. We should explain that like when we think about the 4 equation, we should think about the filter, but definitely. The future only matters. If we have iteration and various. So at a later chapter. We will discuss about the future and. What are its consequences? But right now we need to. Understand the mechanics itself themselves, right? And then maybe we can go to the infinite monkey theorem. Definitely not the way that we explained here. Explain better the monkey term will less. Jumping to conclusions like, what the **** Like, oh, if you select stuff from random, then that's an inevitable success and that's the engine of the world. Like holy **** super. Super arrogant, right? So definitely no big steps, big jumps like that, but. Once you've said. User this example as a selection. If not sure if it's the best one. I think it's OK, but I think we should. From that we should do another example that's even better for selection line OK, so selection is not icky. At random it's selecting the correct letters and then this shapes up. Like because what do we want to do like iteration and various. They work because individuals. Try. Each individual tries its own thing. Very odd thing. And if. They fail, they live, and if they succeed, they reproduce, and then we can talk about that. In biology you can talk about that in a tennis match where like. When when you are learning tennis and you are hitting the ball, if you hit it wrong. And like each time you hit the ball it's a little bit different. So there's a little bit of various. And. And then if it. Works, you start reproducing and doing it more. If it doesn't work, start doing less.

## Session 5: Part III Deep Dive - AI, Markets, and Exams (2025-12-26)
Good. Now back to reviewing OK. So ever had talked about the Chapter 10 and how we need to change it? So I won't go over that again because we didn't have time to edit it already. It's all written down in the last review. So going now to the following chapters. Let's see. OK So training AI. It's something that we need to be super, super. Did that took right? Because it? Because it is a hot start pixel, probably a lot of people kind of understand stuff, but at some time we need to be extra sure, so most people don't know that training AI, select starting from. Simple neurons and then doing some random mathematics and then applying machine learning. So we'll need to teach that. We either show that and teach that in the parts too. Where we are talking about iteration and variation. I think we can show it there. Some place not as a main focus of a chapter. But it would fit to explain the process there. And then let's Chapter 11 use this knowledge that was. Glossed over or briefly briefly explained before. To talk about value function, yeah, maybe. Let's see if it's food similar in the latest park or if it should be here. But if it's either way, it needs to be somewhere. OK just because the way it's written right now. It's a bit out of the blue. Like, oh, I would give Randall noise. Like, why? User Waskda, right? Like why you're giving random noise. And then we introduced a judge like, it's a bit confusing. And also like then we introduce the judge. We define the value function, a mathematical rule that give the computer a high score when it gets closer to a goal and a penalty when it moves away. Didn't we just explain that? In the last chapter, like shouldn't we say like? Then we introduce the judge, a scarring system that makes the AI do what we want. So. If Sir read had read handwritten numbers, it will give points when you practically guess the handwritten and and so forth like. I think it's better. Instead of like explaining again that value function is giving points for something and Pennsylvania like II think it's good to give three or four examples like oh so. We appraised when you correct and get the correct number or if you've got the correct animal. Or in an LLM like in the sense that when the word chosen is like they are correctly predicts the best words. Like are the text that will be written by. Alter or like in the latest AI models like. The AI. We give it's a point if it gets correct answer. Different fields like mathematics and so far flux. So yeah I think it's good to go in some of those like just just say like OK. This is a judge the value function. And then yeah. I don't like how it's written. This AI chapter. It is kind of like a saw, like a. The way it's written doesn't feel interesting. It it it lags like the punchy questions like. After we explain the value function if in question, say some stuff like. Can you see? How a simple? Change in math equation unlike what we are evaluating. Changes the Foo AI behavior. I think this kind of questions in the middle of that paragraphs are in the middle of the chapter are good ways to punctuate what we want the reader to feel or to understand, and I think this will give way more emotion. Yeah, so like we've gave some examples and after giving them. Let's do the epiphany here. Like why did I give all of those so because here check it out. Just by changing this we change it so much. And then we can go back to the examples and like showing how powerful this is so. Just by doing this definition, we were able to, like, correctly define digits OK. That's cool, but then, oh, check how we correctly define. Engagement time and like holy **** now have social media or. Look how we correctly made LLMS that are good now in mathematics or they can now. Able to mimic an outer style. So. Show like the power. Show like the power and like the whole change. Here is just the value function. I think that's. The way that this feels cool. And then yeah, talking about like the burning of the algorithm is not evil, it's just doing what the judge rewarded it for. Like I think this is super good. It's also repeating that AI doesn't have consciousness, but it's super good example to see how. This value function shapes it all. So yeah, I think that's the point. And if more or less got it, but the chapter itself, like, yeah, yeah, we need to rewrite it. Then going to the next chapter. I don't love. The Baker's examples in the sense of talking about the lazy. And the perfectionist stands low. I don't love like the first paragraph here about the Bakers. I think we could do something a little bit different that doesn't have like all of this. Judge of Carter. I think it's more about talking about like. All the first Baker. Do sales expensive and bad tasted and the other one sells tons of and super cheap and and gives some examples. That direction. Like, oh, so I don't know. Some bakers sell only sell bread that's like so huge that only 10 people can eat it. And the other one just sell like small portions for people or wherever, like giving this variance of bread selling and then yeah and then I go we go to, we say that OK at some point the town ends up with good bread and all that. And yes, then talking about Adam Smith and the invisible hand, you think that's awesome. I agree with talking about which paker is the winner. I think it's important to say that one, just one single Baker will win, but that it will converge. And I think it's also interesting to say like. Different cities may have different pakers that would wing, so we kind of end up like. With one type of bakers in Italy, another type of baking in Paris, United States, and in Brazil. Because like what? The townsfolk there are searching for is different, so it's kind of like always. What is being? What's the future? What's the value function in itself? I think that's the beginning of the chapter. So it's like what you said, but I think the way I just did it, I think it's. Better for the reader to attach and understand the point here. 'cause again, we are just talking about we are bringing the concept from nothing Smith to our system. And reminding how different value functions bring. Different. Results and metrics, right, so that I think that's kind of. The beginning here. The part here about capitalism and socialism? I'm thinking about it if it fits well in this chapter or if it should be in the time compounding effect. Cause yes, it does change the judge. So, and by changing the judge it changes behavior and I think it's super interesting to point those out. But maybe like? Who won between capitalism and socialism? At least in the Cold War, it's more in the compounding effect. So. 'cause like in the short term. Socialism seem to work, but then it lost. 'cause it was bringing more and more issues right? And also we could use one of our references from My Nation's fails when they explain about socialism. Extractive and inclusive. Institutions, I think super good to use that reference, but maybe it's about timing. It's it fits better in the parts 4 when we're talking about code compounding effects of timing time here we want to talk about the value functions and how they shape stuff. So I think it's useful to. Capitalism and socialism to talk about life out there. Trying to iterate and change value functions and iterate over different stuff. And if we can talk mostly about like the short term behavior, I think it's better. I think it's in this chapter it would be good to talk about, like when the invisible hand doesn't work. Just like point as like not all value functions are always working. A like a value function is not global or universal, right? So thinking that the invisible hand is the only thing that's at play can be some can be naive and dangerous. So I would go more. Pinch your debt so. Talking about like. Monopolies. Are. Government interference like. Not if it not as an evil thing. Again, just like I'll have country and AA and country B doing stuff. And OK if you just let the invisible hand work. Maybe one country ends up with all the wealth, another not or something like that. So like we have the. Different views from the government and population so. What people value will be a bit different. So I'm not sure we need to think about this chapter because it's hard one and there are a lot of topics that we could be talking so. Yeah, no clear solution here, but I think. I think it's easier to spot what's not with what shouldn't be here. I like the blind spot of the judge. I liked the first paragraph about the herbal builder and the tools and the profits at some limit. I think it's good to talk about the consequences of having the profits. And I and I like comparing with the dumbbell AI that's just over optimized for something. Not sure about this chapter. Uh yeah, we need to think more about it. The next chapter, the. Exam trap. I like the beginning like. Comparing this to schools, but the next paragraph I think still rush it like. The exam factor gets the highest cars in the country, they get the best universities and then the parents flock to disease and factory. I think we need to. Be a bit slower here like. OK. So yeah, the exam factory makes gets the students to this best choose this better university. And then. And then you should think as a parent would you pay your son or daughter in the school where we have higher chances of better universities or to the other so? As an individual, the parents choosing pays it on university. Chance and because of that. Overtime the schools will be selected to be more more like the exam factory and are not like the Academy of Life. Cool II think this. Thought process for the parents is something that's missing here and it's important for us to capture and again always remember like how I'm talking because we want this book to be as close as possible on how I do it, like. How I write stuff or say stuff? Not sure we need to say like it's one of the most powerful examples of how the value function can reshape an entire generation. It's not reshaping that one generation. Because it's been here through centuries, right? Like these exams and universities, it's actually a process of it's more on compounding time part for the next chapter, but. So the way I would say here is less, oh, the most powerful examples. Yeah, like I don't like those sentences. You know that. And it's more like 0. This is the exam prep. It may be cautious or unconscious for people or society as a whole. But just because as an individual level, we. Focus on choosing the. Option that gives better universities at a macro level. The schools, they will all kind of just do. Net. And I think we can also like points like an extra paragraph here and just like to tie with the last chapter talking about. If we talk about individuals. And if it let this alone, like schools, will be just that, just as the market will just focus on profit. And that's can be like one of the. Rules of the government and law and all of that to try to focus on other. Optimizations so like 0 if you want more Academy of lives, we need as lawmakers or. And all that I like to think how can we change the value function and create this other. Rules. So like how can we fight? This how can we shape it at all right so yeah, so we have external forces and players working on here. You can. Mention the. Later we'll discuss like what's more useful and more powerful. Like what's fighting again against the river and what's actually changing the value function, but just that, like if we just let individuals alone, like this would clearly be one of the key things here. So, but yeah, we have different players and I think it's good to have that. I love the conclusion about the metrics, the message. I love the paragraph about emergent behavior. About not teaching people children, like, about managing their bank account, I think that's super. Super good. They lit pivot. Yeah, I I've talked about that and I think we need to. Because it's a hard topic to say. So yeah, definitely. Need to think lot how to expect it. I think it's well written, I'm just not sure if it should be here. Or if it should be. On the compounding time. Because it's good, no? I think it should be here. Later we will mention it because definitely that's. That's a new. Newvalue function that appears later, right? So it. It's a consequence of the compounding of time. But yeah, yeah, I think it's it's fine to be here. It makes sense. And then later we explain like why it's appeared. That said, I don't agree with paragraphs like 0. This greatest strange culture divide. The working class remains rapid in the exam factory. Uh, optimizing for the old metric where the other bike. II think that's a bit too much? Medlis here in Brazil, where I can clearly see the pattern, at least for now. I wouldn't say that the richest are only focusing on this new factor, like it's something that's emerging, but it's not that. The old one, it's dead OK. So I wouldn't, yeah, I don't want to say that. But I find it interesting that it's important to point this like OK. So so then we create this new. Action are like this. New behavior and way of thought and and and yeah. It is real with time, creates a cultural divide between. Type of schools and and yeah, the rich and poor and so forth. But. Nothing as wrong as. You've written here. And then again, I always finish chapters with some. Good paragraph, like punchy paragraph. Write down as a reference. Not a reference in the terms of the knowledge, but reference writing style. Write down about random. Maybe get some quotes from him as well. Would be good. Like Renault, Sanderson always ends each his chapters with some punchy sentences or paragraphs and stuff like that. I think that's kind of what I'm trying to say here. So OK we finish it the exam trap. We should do some paragraphs talking about. How stuff optimize? For exams. But because stuff optimizes for that now we have this emergent behavior as well. So we have two different optimizations happening, so. How important it is to look? At the value function to explain. What are the players in long term? It's always essential to remember that we have this natural variance because there will always be a new director of a new school that will try a different thing because that's how he or she believes education should be. But the pattern. Through time, we'll select successor failure between all of these different features that are trying to do different. Ways to teach.

## Session 6: Part III Synthesis - YouTube & Goodhart's Law (2025-12-26)
Before starting to edit stuff, let's keep going with the review. I want you to review the next chapters, so the algorithms I and you are what you measure, so we have like the full Part 3 reviewed. OK. So let's do that and then we can check stuff later. So the algorithm's I. I like the long sentence of the early days of the Internet There was a video of a chipmunk. Not sure. If should be the first sentence, I think it's good. And if we should say like, oh, let's check this other case of study. No, no. I think, I think, I like like this beginning. I don't think we should

## Session 6: Part III Synthesis - YouTube & Goodhart's Law (2025-12-26)
Before starting to edit stuff, let's keep going with the review. I want you to review the next chapters, so the algorithms I and you are what you measure, so we have like the full Part 3 reviewed. OK. So let's do that and then we can check stuff later. So the algorithm's I. I like te like how thBefore starting to edit stuff, let's e it's super relevant because it's r---

## Sessioe power of the value function. We need to know that any social network like has. Iteration speed and variation like volume like we have millions, even billions of users with. Tons of content so like. I think there's two car far here, the supreme partner like it's good really good case for example. Of the value function and also it's important to see. The power and the consequences here, because when people think about Facebook or Twitter or Youtube, they think of some static stuff. But. Mostly because they don't know when the algorithm changes, but behaviors change as algorithms change and as decisions change. Like even google search. Changes its algorithms overtime, and this changes what's rigid and as most people always click in the first links. These also changes what's most relevant in their Internet and how. Ideas. So like it's. Really really really powerful and shouldn't be taking lightly taken lightly. Also, probably shouldn't be hidden like this is something that. Lawmakers should. Forced to be. Open and transparent. Because the sizes of these companies. Like they they affect the whole world. In ways that was never, ever. Richard before, right. So like algorithm does, yeah, so so so that's kind of the consequences and how the importance of this chapter not saying that we need to write this in this chapter maybe later. But that's what's important. So I don't like the sentence about, oh, it was mostly harmless. No, it's not that. It was that in the beginning of Youtube. All content. Was quick actually you could say that it is harmful because smart content was not able to be born. So like people wouldn't create documentaries or anything like that. You, you, you needed to be done and quick. True, true to exist in Youtube. Should be relevant though. I think we should also always start like. The case. Reminding about the iteration variation, so like. Not sure exactly we're here, but we should say like 0. Imagine Youtube, a place where you have like this greater economy of the less of any person could upload in the Internet. Videos and what's delivered to people more is based on the algorithm. So what is the algorithm and and so far? Some intro like that. Just because, yeah, at this point the user should the, the reader should be. Used to sync like value functions and iterations and variations and how they shape. So we don't need to like be super. Explanatory here, but definitely some introduction here before saying that. Oh because which was optimizing views, it was the smallest videos that appear like. We had videos of all types, but only the quick ones got clicks like that. I think that's good and important to to remind people. Like what is an algorithm in a sense so. And OK so. Going forward. The engineers of Youtube is like is not that they had a problem. And it's not that the user was not happy OK. I think it's important to mention here that like OK, what are the engineers of Youtube trying to do? They are trying. They are trying to grow their site. To bring. More engagement and more revenue. So like the business model for Youtube is ads and you need more, so you need more people seeing, seeing more videos and I like the mark. The more people interact with that side, the more. Companies will be willing. To pay on ads. So the engineers. Started thinking OK. So if we only have quick videos in the platform, people won't see ads because if an ad is the same time as a quick video. People like once enjoy the experience so. They will not use this website. So and what they needed and. Also what they saw is like OK, maybe we need something that makes people watch more OK. So like that's where the value function for the engineers because we always have to remember that each player. It's stakeholder. I think stakeholder could be a good. Word here has its own value function, like its own thing that's trying to optimize for OK. It's on goal, so. So they decided that watch time would make people. Stay more. In the platform 'cause they would see bigger videos, bigger videos are better for you to show one quick add. Because it's one thing to use for you to see at net a 5 second ad for a 5 second video. Another thing to see a 5 second ad for a one minute or five minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes video OK. So that was the engineers. They wanted engagement and they wanted to neighbor ads and then watch time and when you created watch time what you got you got II wouldn't say directly the Minecraft explosion II want to say it, but we need to get there. True logic OK so. Let's go. Everyone's creating a video, their own videos. So there chart videos, long videos. I love that as soon as watch time. Is the main metric. The longest videos will be. Recommended bar. And however can produce more. Video Times. Get more videos recommended so. Short videos. They die. Videos that require a lot of effort per minute or so die so like. News channels, you need to Fact Check stuff, you need to interview people and you need to go to places and all that. So that's hard. Documentaries, that's hard. Animations, that's hard. So a lot of those die. And what flourishes? Well if you are playing a game and you are streaming yourself playing the game. That gross like right that that's that's super quick so. This type of content growth, like even new websites, appears from that logic like to like Twitch but yeah, so Youtube explodes. Watching people play suddenly becomes the stuff that's mostly recommended. And luckily one game out of curiosity here like but luckily one game was really good at that period to being watched, which was Minecraft. So you could bring some correlation between. Minecraft success and Youtube's algorithm change. Like would Minecraft have reached the heights it it got if this algorithm didn't change? Who knows but he he was the lucky one at that moment, so definitely slot of correlations here. So so yeah, we have it like this. Big change in algorithm and then big change in the players that are winning and I think that's one of the core things here that people should learn about that the players. What's being recommended? The main players are based on the value function and a pere instant social platforms because of the amount, the volume of content being created and so the iteration and variance is super huge, super quick, super extreme. So the. Algorithm becomes optimized quite quickly. OK, so that's more or less this shift here. And the idea to teach OK. I think that's the main example that we went from this chapter because this is super. Obvious, super clear like we can we should mention later that like later Youtube changes and nowadays it's the metric does. Way more stuff about it and we as a viewer if you want to can. Research about it and you see papers explaining what's currently going on. But. For the purposes of this book, I think this example. It's kind of the best, at least for. Youtube then. We could. And then we can yeah, I think it's OK to go to the anger engine. Just yeah, that's a more sensitive topic. I think we should mention they still in focus book. Here in the documentary the references that I've written down. Because yeah, it's definitely. A more sensitive topic, right? Let me see here how to say those. OK so the way to explain Anger Engine is a bit bad here. OK because it's not the watch time evolving or anything like that. It's a different. Beast in its entirety OK. So everything has consequences, right? So in social media we need to think about. Content sharing. So sharing through messages and threads. And we need to think about how what? What does the stick? The new players on Tick Tock to Instagram search and all of that. And then say like OK, given all of that, we can talk about like how? Anger or. Sensationalist stuff. Bring more attention and so forth. So they are kind of optimized for more shares just like a virus optimizes for more contagion and. And so far like and then there are hundreds of books and papers and all over place talking about the anger engine. So. No need to be super. Like it won't be the first place that a person saw this, so. That's important too. Frame it all given what we just said about the Youtube and the algorithm and the selection and iteration and why. Engagement and anger. Were like optimizing. I'm not sure like, oh, anger is the ultimate engagement hack like. Because it's not only anger, right? That's right. Now going on like that. It's just that. Being more extreme like. Not telling truths. Making up stuff, talking on to your own bubbles, like, there are a lot of stuff here, right? So I'm not sure if anger is the thing, but I think what we want to find out here is like. The engineers. I trying to get more heads. So they have to. And content is just trying to survive. Just as a virus tries to survive even though it's dead. Accountant and a video just trying to do the same. GI is just trying to do the same so given the environment that was spread has been breeding from. This reds short farm content no time to discussions like seeing what. Our idea resonates with you and all that. Like it's no wonder the content that we are seeing. I think that's more the. The key thing here? So we want people to understand the power of algorithms, understand that there's a reason for us to be where we are in this topic. It's not evil, it's just all the things together. On the next chapter, here you are what you measure. I love the example in Delhi about cobras. Let's be sure that this happened because I didn't know about the story. Super plausible, but I want you to Fact Check that. We can also add a few more examples here because I think it's fun so. There are some famous. AI learning. That it optimize it for the wrong finger. And this famous AI training where the. Robotics hands needed to get the ball. And it'll burn. Its reward function was when we, like the camera, saw the pixels of the hand around the ball. So they're about to kind of, kind of learned true. To mimic the hand in front of the ball, just like a person shoots a photo of them holding the the pizza, the pizza tower in Italy, so like, that's really not what the engineers wanted and. The robotic arm? Definitely not something. That has conscious and evil, but it has. We just did it. Right, because systems optimize Jadera value systems. So I think it's a good example together with the Cobra effect. The example in capitalism. I think better than the about the environment. Which aim? I want to avoid this about like oh capitalism, fixed environment. I think it's. Could be a good one. Just say about like. The fastest way to improve profits is by reducing costs, so. So firing people, right. So yeah, in capitalism we was profited as measure to value creation and shareholders want profit quickly. So one of the common common way to do it is just by creating expenses, firing people even if that in the long term might. Mr Investments. I think it's it's good to mention the capitalism could be the last example from the 4 examples that you've written in the Gothard Trap. So in AI in education, social media, even though like Capitalism was the second chapter. Just because. Alright, it can be the second example, but later we can say like a. Like nowadays, it's even more. It's even clearer the problem about optimizing for profit only, and that firing is a solution because as AI evolves, everyone is now has the fear about companies being run by AI and like having. Huge mass unemployment and stuff like that and. It all came down from 9 on. One idea they passed about like people were proud. I've heard more. Most lot of people like being proud of a company achieving. The Unicorn status of a billion dollars evaluation with lower amount of workers than in the past. So like we have this trend from like fart head. X amount of 1000 of employees. Then we got like Walmart with with this amount of place. Then we got like Netflix. And then we got Whatsapp. And so far, like, smaller and smaller companies and like, people see that as oh, that's awesome. So like. As we are optimizing for that, it's no wonder that AI. Which is a tool that can be used for so many interesting stuff. It's also mostly thought about how to replace people. Like because that's what's been optimized and. As a society, we need to think if that's really what we want to optimize like we really want, do we really want to remove people? From work, will that become a nootopia or a dystopia if people don't need to work, right, and if everyone's unemployed? So yeah, I think, I think it's a good place to to just. Point this paragraph here as a question in the good heart prep. I think that's. After these examples and we talk about capitalism. Or maybe after the cheetah paradox? 'cause I like the Cheetah paradox. It should be here. I just don't like the paragraph we why we say we are doing the same thing to our culture. By optimizing our lives, our business societies, we become cultural shithers. I think that's a bit arrogant. I like the. What we're trying to say, but I think it's too strong as a sentence. So yeah, I think we need to change it a little bit. The end of the chapter I love. Like this perfect.

## Session 7: Part IV Foundations & Chapter 16 Review (December 26, 2025)
No need to be exporting so often. OK. I will start the review process for part 4. So let's write down. Let's save the raw transcript and write down the feedback file. But don't edit the manuscripts yet. Cool. So we're compounding effects. The beginning of the chapter. The first chapter here, the 16th. I think two things. First, like the example that's written on Super Bad III understand the 1% per day. Becomes 37 times, but the way it's written, relaxed impact, it's hard to follow. Yeah, it's kind of useless and at the same time, like it just jumps into that. I think it would be better to to do some bridge here or like some. We should be saying like. Stuff like OK, we we've got how. The value functional effects. And shapes. For it's all. Probably it's optimizes but. What happens if we keep optimizing? But the same thing over time. Just shoot as example. We saw that they got faster and faster. But they got Vagio at the same time, right? So. There were some. Emergent behavior side effects that was not visible. Right. And that's really common. When we talk about. The value function it's optimizing something and at first it may not. Matter the. Earth might compound. But the Ehrmant compound might compound not earth. That's not earth. A horse. A horse errors. Yeah, errors. I'm sorry like you don't understand my English. All the other random words that were written in this transcription here, there were errors and it became stuff like horse or earth. I don't know why so errors. And one thing that we have to so, so I'm going back to the text, right. And one thing that we have to keep in mind when talking about errors is that it can be super small at 1st. But even something small as time compounds. May get big and huge. Then you can talk about the 1% that grows into. Being 37 times just. Let's make it less meth and more impactful. Right. Yeah. It needs to be correct meth wise but. The impact is what matters. I think this sentence about being richer compounds as a big and total dominance later. I think that's a strong statement that should be used in some example later, but not in the the first chapter of that part, because the 1st chapter is always about the theory and the theory itself. Should always be easy to understand les polemic and more about like several examples and trying to. Trying to create their foundations, right? So the foundations for this chapter is all about the compounding effect, how something that is small, gross and how the value function like the the system and environment itself evolves over time, right? So it's about evolving the value function. Maybe we have to think, I'm not clear right now how we need to talk about it, because. We're talking about this all of this through time, right? So. Eros compound. Things optimize as things optimize. Environmental environment changes as environment changes. The value function might change. And their hearts. Starch matter as well O. What these usually creates is that either. Value function goes to the other side and then we start this cycles. Where something. Like where the value function kind of cycles. In One Direction to the other, depending on. Those compounding optimizations. Are it can explode into extremes, right? It usually kind of have like both of those those depends like the from several iterations. But it's important to see stuff this way over time, like that's a car idea for this chapter here, right? Because we're trying to lay down the foundations. And not exactly. Be super polemic from the get go and talking about the rich people having a lot of advantage from the first chapter might it's like. I think everyone understands it, but it not super obvious. So and it's more examples and we'll definitely talk about that later. That's sad talking in Brazil with the sleek about at 15%. It's super important to explain what the Silic rate is like the interest rate. There are A, lot of people who are not from Brazil reading this book and even Brazilians who don't know what this is. So it's important to tell. But now in a comparison about like for the money that's these two people have together. I think that's a really good. Comparison. I think that math is wrong. Here, I'll list the sums here. OK so that someone. Yeah, yeah. We need to check the the this, the math here and assembly two people making same amount of money when working when not when not working. Like let's let compounds the money. Like in three years or in 10 years, how much further the one that had the bun in the beginning will have just by? Being the front. I think that's a good way to explain compounding. So yeah, definitely. Definitely useful. But yeah, like II wouldn't go into evil and lazy, rich and poor. That sense is just about it is what it is, right? The the math is there, the compounding effects there. Also I would like for you to go into all chapters and like remove the bridges and other things. To be closer to the style that we have been writing stuff right now. Yeah, but Far was not dutched up since the first very first draft, and since then I've set quite a few things that I usually like. So not being good and evil, the past is better than today like. Each chapter being something finishing with a good definition and so far right. There are quite a few things that we discuss it. And thinking about the. Yeah, I'll think later about the chapters. Please first write down. Review.

## Session 4: Reviewing Chapter 16 & The Compound Effect (2025-12-28)
Good, so I start a review process if you read my. Process how I do it. The reviews. Usually I prefer that you don't. Add it just saved a review on the feedback folder and saved the raw transcript as well for later usage OK. So I'm looking at reading again The Compounds Effect, chapter 16. This chapter doesn't feel right at all. Here like there there are few things that are a bit strange. So first. The beginning. Talking about the giraffes. Here. Get the idea? Like the message, the way that you're trying. We're trying to stay there, but no. That's not a good example like the trade offs doesn't seem to matter that much. Oh OK the the giraffes taller and has some small issues to handle like So what? Right, we should see stuff. That is optimized for something, but then that's awful for another or like so. Emergent issue appeared. Because of. This huge specialization that happened, our authorization that happened over time that that that would be way better to explain the concept of system. Of systemic horse compounding over time. It would also start the way the chapter a bit different, like in the way to say it. Like the idea here. I don't like this superlative sentences that you write up back and forth like oh add the most powerful variable in the universe. Time II. Don't like superlative stuff? Please. Write this now, even the user. Pattern and style framework. Because yeah, like, this is not me. That's not how I talk, or at least not how I want to write down stuff. It's a super arrogant seems. Yeah, yeah, I just don't like it. OK. So yeah, the first three paragraphs are kind of right, but the way that's written, it's a bit strange. Then yes, I don't want to say the giraffe, so you need to think about some other example. To talk about. Take a look at my seeds, seeds and. Like which example could be good? Here like something that's simple and easy to understand. But 'cause it was introducing the the concepts here, right? Maybe we also can at the beginning of here the chapter like what do we want to say like the idea of the compound. Compound is talk about like. Oh, last chapter we've talked about the future, and that's playing like the direction that stuff goes. And So what sends you happier overtime and like how things optimize. So we kind of already talked about time, that's why we're not introducing time because we kind of already did. What we are trying to introduce here is. Are the consequences or like? 'cause you mentioned about it before, right? So it's more about the consequences and like how the value function works over time and yeah. So yeah, we have to think about descent is in a sense it is time, because before we were just saying stuff like it was standing still or like just a fact. But yeah. We need to think this here. Remove the giriffe. Check some seeds for previous ideas that I had. I'm not sure if I like this sentence like this first rule of the compounder EHR's compound just as fast optimizations. If indeed the first rule here is that like. Optimization like the value. The first rule here is that the value function defines what wings. And what's define it? But it doesn't. It's not perfect and won't feature for every aspect. So it hurts. It hurts. We will occur. And as time goes by, dose the horse. Will scale. Your compound. Then you have the example of the company. Optimizing for quarterly profits, I think it's good and there's stuff there. We just need to think. What? Like, how can we explain this a little bit better? Like, just too quick, too brief? The example can be about value cost cutting, so removing. Workforce. So that we have. Higher, uh. Profits. We could do as an even as an example some companies that reduce it too much people. But then they weren't ready for times of crisis. I think INEL can be a good example and now is energy energy company here. In Brazil, San Paulo. It's a privacy business that handles energy transmission delivery for here, and it's it has cut people. And that's all fine. But then. Because of recent. Stronger weather. Well, we've had more trees falling in the city than. Usual. And the company? Had become way too efficient, like in the sense that try to reduce personnel as much as possible to improve profits. That was not. Able to handle the amount of trees. Had fallen and then because of that we've seen like. Millions of people here in Sao Paulo without energy fire multiple days. And these types of issues. It started not happening. Actually thinking here, not sure if this is a good. OK it's gonna be, because, yeah, it's optimizing for. Short term revenue. So it's OK. Yeah, not sure about that example. I think we can write that later review. It. I like the sentence that at first the change is so small this looks like noise, then it looks like a trend, and finally it's like an explosion. I like that sentence. I think that can be. Use it a few times, or at least. Even some. Just stuck. Not sure how to say that in English, like some attention to friends. Board formatting 's? I don't know. Yeah. Then we go to the 1% impact. I think that paragraph's totally off. I think you got that from somewhere else and because I was talking about 1%. But saying that at first company to companies working the same, like one being 1% better than the other seems fine, then one's best there than other. Like that's totally out of this book here 'cause that can be true, but that's just. The value function of optimizing for the company who has the best leather efficiency even if it's just a small one perce percent margin so. Yeah, like that idea is is interesting, but definitely not. We what do we want to say about the compound effect here? Is less. Less about. Is more advantageous compounding. And like. What is the compound effect OK so so like it is that overtime? A horse may compound. And optimizations may over optimize. In such a way. That the. That the environment itself, like the system itself, changes, so the value function may change as well. Because things will can, things will scale to some point of optimization that will will have consequences. And they can either explode, like, exponentially speaking, or they can, yeah, get strength that makes them go back. You've written that somewhere in here. Let me see, it's written here like. Like the perfect paragraph here is the one that you said. Yeah, like the two paragraphs, the compound effect is a process by which the output of 1 cycle of the engine because the inputs are the next. It's the reason why systems don't stay in balance. They either spiral towards stream optimization or they collapse under the weight of of compounded errors. In that regards. In that regards compound the facts they either. Become that regards this the systems either become more extreme. Overtime. Are they oscillate? And you could even argue that in an even larger time frame. Even the extreme could be just an isolation. But for that, we're not totally sure. Yeah. Like, I think that's more or less it, like that the the, the whole idea and I think that's the best paragraph you said. So when you go like to the 1% impact, I don't like the. 1% a day becomes 37 times better in a year like. At least not in the sense of like 02 companies fighting. And one is 1% better then because better because. We kind of already drove the points of things going as the value function things they should. OK. This part is not about that in itself. It is. It could be like we could talk about one percent, the sense that let's say that. Each year that passes through capitalism. Companies become. 1% more efficient, efficient. In 100 years. Of capitalism. This efficiency would be. X amount of times. More than the beginning. I think that's also interesting. Like we could even like. Bring some numbers from real world data, because I think we can see stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that. I think that's good because OK so if like if we take capitalism for like early 19, nine hundreds, so now that if if we argue that's one percent every year that's getting better. After years. This is this amount of times better and this means that the next. 10 years or the next? 50 years will be. This amount. And if we had this amount of workers? A car. Then by this here this year X we would have only one worker like this small amount of workers. I think this comparison is super good 'cause it shows the trend like. It is a system optimizing for efficiency. In itself. And then, yeah, I think that's a really good example and I think we should do that. Then after saying that, we should say. Where do you draw the line? It's harder to. It's not obvious. Like it may be good to reduce from 10,000 workers to 1000 workers, or even to 100, but then from 100 to ten people. You start questioning like. What are all the other people doing like? How is this power dynamics going to work? And then after when it's just one person like I think it's super clear so. One could argue. That at what points would we stop and as a society we've started discussing that and. Justice by the fact that we've started discussing the fact that this over efficiency. May not be good. May. Their reason like maybe I just an effect of the compounding effect in the sense that it is over optimized so the value function in itself is. Maybe shifting? Because. If in the beginning, being more efficient meant having better lifestyles. With more healthcare, better lives and so forth like. At some point here. It may like being more efficient might not help us get this better lifestyles. Not sure here, let's see what should be done. Just explaining. And cause and effects here, I think that yeah, I think this is super good. Like because this way I'm searching about. Like explaining the over optimization overtime, so like. And showing kind of the consequence of it, because it's super like it's over optimize it. Then I yeah I agree on showing the power of the buffer and I think it's it can be called the buffer. I think it's OK. Just need to review the math here. You were definitely wrong about the math just because by the end you say that 0 Anna is twice as rich as. Than Bruno, which like no, it's way more than twice as well. We have some rhythm. It's not clear, but we could say like, even if it's not Anna, we could talk about like the grandchildren. Even if cause 50 years is not one generation right, it's more than it so. Yeah, like we could say like oh, OK. So it's it can be fair between and Bruno like some people would even argue that's OK, but then what about their children? And then red should like the difference would be $100 million and Are you sure about $100 million seems a lot. But it can be. It could be like the difference between them. Brazil had like 45 years of democracy. We could talk about like a similar time range. Not sure if we need to do if. I think that. Yeah, not sure, not sure, just write down the idea, but I think we can just fix the numbers. And then the definition. I like it the first the first paragraphs. As I mentioned, they're perfect. And no, we do not need to look start looking at the rate of change OK that's the wrong. Take away here. The take away here. I think that's two things. So 11. They either inspire or they collapse under the weight of compounded errors. I think that sentence is great. And maybe we should talk about things of oscillations here. Save it for the next next. Chapter 100% sure, but definitely the take away is not about the rate of change, it's about looking at how the value function. May change over time, like how did the value value function drives? The competition. How it will optimize overtime? What side effects? Could it be bringing and what will come? What looks to be to compound overtime? On it like that. That's more or less the idea here. The and the take away. And no, I don't like the bridge for the way that's not and and also II didn't read that yet, but it's probably not a good chapter to be there. I would check, I would check.

## Session 5: Refactoring Part IV & Venture Capital (2025-12-28)
Let's keep doing the review, shall we? Umm, so I think actually that you didn't understand what the compounds cause reading the chapters here like. Even the subtitle like for the compounder, which is the power of time and inevitability of inequality, like what the **** No. That's not the meaning of part for the compounder. That's not even the goal for this part. Like, no, no, that's wrong. And then the way your chapter like super bad, like holy **** it's really. Bad. Really, really, really bad. Has nothing to do with what we say. The venture capital. I want you to read again. Both like the raw transcripts that created the SID as the the SID file. It was meant. To kind of. Be an analysis. Of how? They start up ecosystem evolved over the decades. And a system that at the beginning. At first began. As a way to empower. New ideas? And to Fast forward. Innovation. Became kind of game fired. Because, and it's a super difficult topic OK to talk about. So definitely this topic needs a whole chapter, at least like 12 pages. Just about that just explain this, not one paragraph. It's like a full two pages at least like to explain like how it began. Being about fast forwarding, but then it's super hard for you to measure. Results when you don't need to be profitable. So. Because for you to survive, we need to raise more, and for you to raise more. You it's you need to show your business better. So you need to show numbers. Growth numbers and you can spend on growth even without bringing much revenue. You have much revenue. Not being sustainable, so spending a lot. So it's about a game of connections. Being well recommended to other people. Bringing revenue, showing good members and then over time this got more and more optimized. So. The companies that came out of this. System would be. More and more the ones that have like good connections and can raise more and the as the year passes by. This may get even more extreme. Like nowadays we are seeing like this huge venture capital deals for companies like sometimes even from the like the power points. Far like companies on AI and stuff. And like you could argue about how much this change it and shift it overtime. Yeah. And and that's mostly about the compounding. Like the value function. Not actually evaluating what really matters mattered. And yeah, like. That's definitely something that II would need to even study more. Just so that we can have a really good chapter about it, but I think it's essential to have one about venture capture. We need also to explain what's venture capture is because most people don't have a clue like they have heard the name but like. They don't know the business model, so they don't know how that's like sustainable. At the beginning, 'cause like venture capital is what they become like for at the beginning. Person invested in something in the company and then they wanted return in next amount of years and so that and that and then like explain how the first venture venture capitals started like in in business wise like how? When Dio can bring you 10XA 100X so you can have most investments fail, you just need one to succeed. So how to? Like explain that numbers, those numbers and like the logic and the consequences on that. And then and then, yeah, like show the compounding. So that topic. It's own chapter, super important. Nothing to do with the way your economy. And the wayo economy here, like you got it all wrong. Like what the players are the environment like, no like and then why is the way economy, the compounding effects are tough time like what when has to do with the other? Super wrong. Super wrong. But I was. I would like for you to read again what I said about the way your economy and think. Of where in the book should we add about that topic 'cause that topic's it's it's relevant? But we can also don't add it in the book if it's not useful.

## Session 6: Part IV Deep Refactor (2025-12-28)
Yes, please clean up the next session notes. I've seen one inconsistency here, like the part for the compounder, the subtitles, and the manuscript. It's the old one, like the power of time. Inevitability of inequality. That's wrong. This was not what we agreed on. It's probably somewhere in the exports that makes this mistake, but even still, let's fix it. And going reviewing like chapter 16. That's a hard chapter. I think all the the whole compound. Part is hard. To to do, to write. OK. But it's definitely getting there. I think the a 100 year shift. It's well written, just some small tricks here I would do. We've freed 9000 people from backbreaking labor. The goods are cheaper. The world's moving faster. Mabes write it some way differently. At least, like what's back breaking and probably what 10,000 workers would be more than one factory. The early nine thousands. Nineteen titles. It's like the the. To put a factory process might like a. A consumer good might need might need a few factories and had like 10,000 workers just make sense because one factory having 10,000 workers a bit too much. But still the the whole star is good. We're not sure. If the wording is suddenly the feeling, the wrong changes. I think the sentence here. Can change and maybe the sentence is before because like. Oh yeah, so it was efficiency, but is it now like good? It was good, but is it not good? Like suddenly feeling the room changes? Could be something different like a. Suddenly. I'll ask a question directly to the viewer. Like. No. Yeah. It can be suddenly. The feeling. Not sure. Not sure what. We should be right there. The next paragraph's good, but then the last one. I think it doesn't end well like. It's not. Deficiency is bad that it has compounded to a point where the side effects are now larger than the benefits. I'm not sure if the side effects are larger than the benefits, and also I'm not sure if it's richer it. Right, because you still have companies with 100 people. So it's not that, but we are going there. So the sentence here is different. It's not that efficiency is bad, is that it has. It's all drawbacks and. We. Think more. About. About that I would say something like that in the paragraph and then it's missing the the next paragraph time back to the to what we're talking about the compound of time, so talking. So one paragraph, one or two paragraphs at least talking about or even more when I'm saying like OK. So at first the value function did. Focus on efficiency. But it became over optimized and as it becomes over optimized. Their own judges for. That created the the value function at first starts to question the value function itself, so that's that's one way back. That's one way of compounding. Changing value function over time. Or at least we are in the debate for it. I think it's good to say about it. Not sure if it's roulette directly or save it for later, because we always need to think about the whole part, right? Because let's think about it, the compound effect. Chapter 16 is an introduction to this concept of time and compounding and. So we have this when this example of optimization that. Becomes a bit too optimized. The power of the buffer it's not much about the engine itself. It's just about the how time. Scale stuff. Please raise again the whole chapter and tell me like if you think we should add more example or change the structure for it because like based on last parts what we wanted to do is like when. To go whole idea here is to introduce the concept right? Like comparing with. The invisible judge. Which was the introduction for the future? It was really good to tying down. Time back to the previous chapter. So we talked about the virus, the salesman. The Savannah. And like tied really well with like how those? Those are all directed by the value function like. What is this? So it's super. Intraday. Gives a lot of examples on that, and then later it goes to jeopardize. And if you go even back like for the first like the the. Chapter three, which the adaptation equation lengths. Superterrhole. It's talking about the dog, how to sit, the infinite monkey. So it's teaching the concept. I think we should do something similar for the first chapter. Of part for the compounder, so not sure. If the examples here are too deep. If we should change it a bit or not? I like the examples. If we remove from this chapter, we need to add them somewhere else. Are maybe change something on this chapter? It should be more about the theory, but it would be even better if we tie down with. Another another examples that we've given so. For example, we could explain why a pandemic started happening in. Because like populations has grew so as population grew over time cause. Valve function made smart people like so it became extreme. Then something that was hard to happen, which was a quick spread spread of a virus over the world happened and we had Kovid which was not possible before. So that's like a breaking change example. We can talk. About. I don't think we need to talk about AI as an example. I think it's not been long enough. I think the invisible hand is one that's really good to give some examples. 'cause we we talked about metric swapping on the last. Less no, Chapter 12, and I think we could just give it a name now talking about how this was kind of already talking about the compounding effect. The exempt Rep is also a really good example, but. Time, right? Because it's talking about. How the elite? Like how schools became one way, then the elite became another. Or maybe not sure because we don't need we don't want to be super repetitive OK so. It's good to type back. But if it's good to type back, if it gives a new lens to what we said, or gives more new information, if it's just the same explanation, it's bad. But yeah, like the first the first chapter in the compounder. It's better when it's has smaller. I see it's march to be theory right? To introduce the topic, I think the power of buffer is important, but not sure if the name should be buffer and like the power what. What the idea here is trying to say is like how? Small things become big with time. And that's a car thing to introduce here because we want to introduce that small things. Grow over time. And as those happen. Like we have like the the value function and this system it it feeds itself and that's it feeds itself it may change. The. Can be its own chapter or code fit here? Not sure. Love your suggestion. Then on the next chapter, Chapter 17, Thresholds and Breakpoints. Yeah, the introduction chapter could change. The introduction paragraph could change. Or maybe we can add like the whole capitalism story to its own chapter after the compound. Like the compound, it's it's it's on chapter theory and talking about several different examples and going with the car concept about time. Compounding. And then we have one chapter focusing on like how small advantages become image can be become insurmountable gaps. Then we can go over chapter 17 about the thresholds and break points. The example talking about this lime, I think it's really good until the last the last paragraph when you will reach the two hits. We need to be super. Super clear like some people are bad with meth OK so. It's used to be three hits to kill. Now it's two hits to kill, a 33% time to kill difference. Which makes sense, which can suddenly make an enemy of or an encounter that used to be to take too long or be too hard become easy. And a breeze. And this is a huge shift that. The player will definitely feel and definitely evoke some. So as a game designer you always need to think about it, and in the real world you always need to think about those as well. And the last and then the paragraph following like it is kind of 30% increase twice. So the way that you've made the wording about like OH-1 time is 30% increase did nothing and then the other it was super tiny and did other change like the Super tiny was also a 30%, almost 30% rounded up, right. But yeah still that's like the way we are, we are seeing it. We should change it just so that doesn't feel far said in the sense that. We are being fair with like the change. Like it's two changes of the same size you could say, but 1 did nothing in the 2nd one did all the difference in the world. Where you you mentioned. If we mention a nail from Sao Paulo, we need to have true numbers otherwise. It will be just wrong, but if we. What if you want to keep the? If you want to keep the simple example here with these fake numbers, then just remove the name and L in Sao Paulo. Or say like take a fictitious large energy company. Like it now in Sao Paolo and then give it a bit of it. Context, but I think that now is not in the stock market. It was not the darling the stock market. Like, don't make this up. Yeah. Yeah. Either no, no name for the company or true story. And when feeling the story that's missing is about is about the the weather. So like 0 every year X amount of trees fall down and they destroy energy cables. So we have to have these workers keeping the energy on. So they reduce it and became more and more efficient and. The workers in that company did what they needed to do. Like the management was a good manager, the manager was a good manager. He needed to increase profits. So he made the math for the correct. The correct number of employees. That would bring like fix those trees without increasing the price of energy, but then suddenly. Weather become more more extreme. You can say global warming and then your predictions are are wrong because you are over efficient and then in this case you just end up with a city with so much so much people. With no, no no Internet. Yeah. Yeah. And the wording itself, like I think, yeah. I think we can improve this. The Death of Less Complexity title you're a super owner. What the **** It was an example for a reference that you've written down. It should not be a title for the the like a. There's more header for other part here in this chapter like no. Does that make a bit of sense here? What what do we want to say is like we could give more example, we're not like, so we have the RPG example, we have the energy company. Example, we could add another one could be like say. Material resistance. So a really good example of breaking steps is like how you can. Flex a rubber band. And until some point it. Breaks down. It's like that is just like just naps. Like the breaking point, the thresholds just this snap from the elastic, right? So we can add that and maybe add some more example on engineer or one other example of some breaking point that could. Be good for like our. Readers, that maybe is less technical. Yeah. So, so the idea here for this chapter is this one about breaking points like thresholds, anything I think we are mostly driving. And like, are you optimizing for the spreadsheet or watching the for the Cliff, the sentence? I don't like it. Because it feels like I'm. Beating the bird like I'm beating down people who work and who are trying to afford efficiency and I don't want that. I think the question here is like. The question here should be like more like. Can you see? When looking into a system, it's essential to look for the cliffs. And the braking points and not just for what being optimized. That's the car ditching here, right? If the. If before we was talking about the power of compounding. Here we are talking about the breaking points. Maybe the breaking point, like maybe we should change orders also like the thresholds and break points maybe should be after. The evolution of venture capital, because, I think the evolution of venture capital. Is marrying line with the compounding effect and example of capitalism. I think we can. I think we can do like two chapters. So like 1 theory chapter we have a lot a lot of examples from from back and with the power of buffer. Then one chapter about the. Capitalism, efficiency evolving and we should also add some other example about. Optimization over. Overtime. Probably an example that's not related to capitalism or politics, just so we we kind of change. The topic. Address stuff that could matter for other type of people. So it could be nature could be. I don't know. We need to think about it. Then a chapter for the evolution of major capital and. Then back to the chapter of the thresholds of brake points, because evolution of venture capital is still about the compounding. It's just that. Compounding itself. In the end, the compounding itself changes the value function, right? So we thought we were like at the beginning we were optimizing for one thing. But as times goes by like. What was being optimized? Kind of change it because. What? At least what we thought was being optimized was actually another thing. That's kind of what. The The Evolution of venture capital chapter is trying to say right? The **** dilemma. It's a bit. Quick, maybe we could add actually add the shita's dilemma with the capitalism. Because it's the same sense like over optimization. Yeah yeah yeah, actually make the **** as dilemma become the the first chapter after the theory. With the capitalism because both are like centuries and both are talking about over optimization and its consequences and so right now it's super small chapter, so it makes sense to have. This, yeah, totally, totally makes sense. Then the pendulum. It's definitely at the next chapter. And we need to think about the panel. The pendulum is like should talk about fashion, it should talk about how. These value functions that change it and these break points create reactions and those reactions. They kind of. Create a new. Environment with a new. Environment and. Nearby. A new value function and I think one of the best examples we can take talk about is the weather. We can talk about like the Arctic ages in the past, how like the world got some hot. Periods, then cold periods, then hot periods and this was a super good example of an oscillation system. And that right now, we are the global warming era. It is definitely getting faster by human nature. By human intervention and we could have break broken a point that stops the oscillation and becomes another. Pattern, and that's one of the car things that make is. Dangerous and makes this alarming. But yeah, I think we should mention that but but the the focus about talking about the weather is talking about the cycles right and how the value function itself in the end because. Value function is affecting itself and then add another chapter. We need one another, but would be the last one for the the depart for which is the synthesis for the compound effect right? So. Be given. The current idea here for this part is to talk about consequences. Over time. Right, so. We need a synthesis where we. Talk more and go back and talk OK we've we've seen. How time itself can make even as more things big? How value function? If the value function is defining stuff as it goes by, it can over optimize stuff. Create emergent behaviors that will not planned it can. Create breaking points that can bring like and. Those strangers can be continuous or. Ah. Instantaneous with breaking point and then we can talk and also how the systems can oscillate. Or just grow forever like. And as the reader, you should now be able to see this. To see all of those best, right? That's more, more or less like. That's the whole goal of this part, and this should be the synthesis. So yeah, first save this raw transcript. Second write down on feedback folder this review so we have it. And don't add it. And then you can edit the files with all the changes. That I said, there are a lot of changes so. Pay attention to it.
