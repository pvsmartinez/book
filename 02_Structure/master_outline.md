**Status:** Active Working Draft
**Structure Strategy:** Granular, Rhythmic (Theory $\rightarrow$ Deep Dive Examples $\rightarrow$ Synthesis/Bridge).

---

## Part I: The Hook
*Goal: Bring the reader to the correct mindset. Connect with the feeling that the world is "heavier" and introduce the salesman's perspective.*

**Preface: The Humble Start**
*   **Goal:** Set the tone. Move from "I have the answer" to "I found a pattern."
*   **Key Concept:** The author as a fellow traveler, not a guru.

**Chapter 1: Does the World Feel More Extreme?**
*   **The Question:** Start with the feeling. Politics feels louder, wealth feels more concentrated, attention spans feel shorter.
*   **The Glimpse:** It’s not chaos; it’s optimization. Show 3 quick snapshots (e.g., a viral tweet, a billionaire, a bacteria).
*   **The Promise:** We will build a framework to understand *why* this happens and how to navigate it.

**Chapter 2: The Salesman Bridge**
*   **Goal:** Introduce the concept of Selection without using technical jargon.
*   **Story:** The door-to-door salesman. The one who survives isn't the "best" human, but the one who fits the environment.
