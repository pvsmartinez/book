## Feedback Summary

### Part IV Structure & Subtitle
*   **Subtitle Fix:** Change from "The Power of Time and Inevitability of Inequality" to **"The Compounder: Time and its Consequences"**.
*   **New Chapter Order:**
    1.  **Chapter 16: The Compound Effect (Theory)** - Introduction to compounding, small things becoming big, tying back to previous parts.
    2.  **Chapter 17: The Cheetah's Dilemma (Over-optimization)** - Merging Cheetah example with capitalism over-optimization.
    3.  **Chapter 19: The Evolution of Venture Capital** - Compounding selection pressures (Profit -> Growth -> Valuation).
    4.  **Chapter 19: Thresholds and Breakpoints** - Non-linear shifts, RPG math, and systemic cliffs.
    5.  **Chapter 20: The Pendulum** - Oscillation, cycles, weather/ice ages, and broken cycles (Global Warming).
    6.  **Chapter 21: Synthesis: The Compounder** - Bringing it all together.

### Chapter 16: The Compound Effect (Theory)
*   **100-Year Shift:** Refine the factory example. Use a consumer good across multiple factories (10,000 workers total).
*   **Tone:** Clarify that efficiency isn't "bad," but has compounding side effects.
*   **Theory:** Tie back to Part II (Savanna, Virus, Salesman) and Part III (Invisible Hand, Exam Trap).
*   **New Example:** Pandemic spread (2020) as a result of population growth and connectivity compounding over time.
*   **Buffer:** Keep the Ana vs. Bruno example but focus on "small things becoming big."

### Chapter 17: The Cheetah's Dilemma (Over-optimization)
*   **Merge:** Combine the Cheetah's fragility with the story of capitalism's over-optimization for efficiency.
*   **Focus:** How centuries of optimization create emergent behaviors and fragility.

### Chapter 18: The Evolution of Venture Capital
*   **Focus:** Compounding selection pressures. How the "Judge" shifted from Profit to Growth to Valuation.

### Chapter 19: Thresholds and Breakpoints
*   **RPG Math:** Be explicit (3 hits vs 2 hits = 33% time-to-kill difference).
*   **Energy Company Example:** Remove "ENEL" name. Focus on weather/extreme events making efficiency calculations wrong.
*   **New Examples:** Material resistance (rubber band snapping), engineering, or less technical examples.
*   **Ending:** Focus on looking for cliffs, not just spreadsheets.

### Chapter 20: The Pendulum
*   **Focus:** Oscillation and cycles.
*   **Example:** Weather/Ice Ages as a stable cycle. Global Warming as a broken cycle/new pattern.

### Chapter 21: Synthesis: The Compounder
*   **Goal:** Summarize consequences over time, over-optimization, emergent behavior, breaking points, and oscillation.
