# Review: Part I & General Feedback
**Date:** 2025-12-25
**Source:** Voice Transcript (Session 4)

## General Impressions
*   [ ] **Title:** "Unified Selection Framework" is too rigid/academic. Needs to be unique, memorable, non-clickbait, but not dry.
*   [ ] **Cover Page:** Font/layout needs work (Low Priority).
*   [ ] **Table of Contents:** Formatting issues (two pages, inconsistent lettering).
*   [ ] **References:** Hyperlinks should be converted to footnotes/endnotes for print readiness.

## Structural Changes
*   [ ] **New Chapter:** Add a **Preface** or **Chapter 0** before Part I.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Disclaimer: Author is not an expert in game design, politics, economics, etc.
        *   Purpose: Using diverse examples to show common patterns/systems.
        *   Goal: Help readers step back, see the "trap," and think together about changing it.

## Specific Edits: Part I - Chapter 1
*   [ ] **Opening:** The start feels "cold." The news examples (paragraphs 1-3) are disjointed (specific -> generic -> specific).
*   [ ] **Pacing & Escalation:** The chapter feels rushed.
    *   **Fix:** Show headlines escalating over time (e.g., 2000 -> 2005 -> 2010...) to demonstrate the feeling of things "vibrating at a higher frequency" and compounding.
*   [ ] **"It's Exhausting" Section:** The "I am an optimist" paragraph feels unsupported. Needs better setup or placement.
*   [ ] **"Evil CEOs/Politicians":** Needs more discussion/buildup before jumping to the "It's just math" conclusion.
*   [ ] **Phrasing:**
    *   *Avoid:* "Designed to work."
    *   *Prefer:* "Optimizing for things we didn't expect" or "Selecting/incentivized to go where it is going."
*   [ ] **Examples:**
    *   *Keep:* YouTube example.
    *   *Remove/Replace:* The "killer" example (feels out of place).

## Action Items for AI
*   [ ] Draft the **Preface / Chapter 0**.
*   [ ] Rewrite **Chapter 1** with the new pacing (timeline of headlines) and phrasing adjustments.
*   [ ] Brainstorm new book titles.
