### 1. The Blind Men and the Elephant
*   **The Parable:** Six blind men touching an elephant.
*   **The Problem:** We look at the world in snapshots.
*   **The Solution:** We need to see the *whole animal*. We need a Map.

*   **The Lesson:** You don't have an income problem; you have a drain problem.

### 3. The Loops (The Engine of Compounding)

*   **Balancing Loops (The Thermostat):** Input -> Resistance -> Stability.

### 4. How to Build a Model (The Work-Life Trap)
*   **The Case Study:** Mapping how "Trying Harder" leads to "Burnout."
