# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Draft
**Goal:** Define the mechanics of **The Pattern** (Iteration & Variance) using didactic examples.

---

### 1. The Engine
*   **Concept:** We saw the "Filter" (The Environment) in the Salesman example. But a filter needs something to filter.
*   **The Question:** How do we generate the options? How does the salesman *find* the right pitch?
*   **The Answer:** The Adaptation Equation.
    *   **$Adaptation = \frac{Filter(Iteration \times Variance)}{Time}$**

### 2. Variable 1: Iteration (Action + Feedback)
*   **Definition:** Iteration is not just doing the same thing twice. It is **Action + Feedback**.
*   **Example: The Dog.**
    *   Dog sits -> You give cookie (Positive Feedback).
    *   Dog sits -> You shout (Negative Feedback).
    *   *Key:* Without the cookie (feedback), the dog is just moving randomly.
*   **Example: Tennis.**
    *   You hit the ball. It goes into the net. Your brain registers "Too low."
    *   You hit again. It goes out. Your brain registers "Too high."
    *   You hit again. Perfect. Your brain registers "Like that."

### 3. Variable 2: Variance (The Difference)
*   **Definition:** Variance is the deviation from the norm.
*   **The Quote:** "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."
    *   If you hit the tennis ball *exactly* the same way every time, and it hits the net, you will never learn. You *need* the error. You need the variance.
*   **Types of Variance:**
    *   *Micro:* Muscle tremors, slight changes in tone of voice.
    *   *Macro:* Genetic mutations, trying a completely new business strategy.

### 4. The Infinite Monkey (Revisited)
*   **The Theorem:** Infinite monkeys + typewriters = Shakespeare.
*   **The Reality:** We don't have infinite time.
*   **The Fix:** We have **Selection**.
    *   If every time a monkey types a correct letter, we "lock" it (Feedback), we don't need infinite time. We need surprisingly little time.
    *   This is how the world works. It doesn't try everything. It tries, filters, keeps what works, and iterates from there.
