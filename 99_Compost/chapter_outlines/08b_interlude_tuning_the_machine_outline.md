# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Synthesized
**Goal:** A workshop chapter. How to manually control the speed of the engine using the three levers discussed in this Part.

---

### The Dashboard
*   **The Concept:** The engine isn't magic. It has dials.
*   **The Application:** If you want to learn faster (or evolve a product faster), you can't just "try hard." You have to tune the machine.

### Lever 1: Volume (The Insect vs. The Elephant)
*   **Concept:** Parallelism wins.
*   **The Trap (The Cannonball):** Spending years aiming one perfect shot.
*   **The Fix (The Missile):** Firing 10 imperfect shots and correcting course.
*   **Rule:** Quality comes from Quantity.

### Lever 2: Variance (The Tennis Swing)
*   **Concept:** You can't learn if you don't miss.
*   **The Trap (Fear):** Doing the same safe thing creates "Local Maxima." You survive, but you don't thrive.
*   **The Fix:** Intentional Error. Trying a new grip. A/B testing a weird headline.
*   **Rule:** If the error rate is zero, the learning rate is zero.

### Lever 3: Latency (The Stove vs. The Cigarette)
*   **Concept:** The time between Action and Consequence.
*   **The Trap (The Architect):** Building in a cave for 12 months (Loop Speed = 1 Year).
*   **The Fix (The Iterator):** Shipping a prototype in 1 week (Loop Speed = 1 Week).
*   **Rule:** Shrink the loop.
