# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Refactored (Session 6)
**Goal:** Explain how systems correct themselves through oscillation and why stopping the pendulum leads to systemic collapse.

---

### 1. The Concept: Oscillation
*   **The Theory:** Healthy systems breathe. They swing back and forth.
*   **Examples:** Fashion, Politics, Markets.
*   **The Logic:** As players optimize for the current environment, they change the environment, making the opposite strategy more "fit."

### 2. Static vs. Dynamic Systems
*   **Static:** Trying to stop the swing (Bailouts, Censorship). This builds potential energy.
*   **Dynamic:** Allowing the correction.
*   **The Weather Example:** When the "Pattern" of weather breaks (no rain for months), the eventual correction is a flood, not a drizzle.

### 3. The Danger of Extremism
*   **Closing Thought:** When a system stops oscillating, it is a sign of impending collapse.
