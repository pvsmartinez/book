# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Draft
**Goal:** Show that the "Pattern" is universal and that "Speed" is the only difference between biological and digital/viral evolution.

---

### 1. The Slow Pattern: The Giraffe
*   **The Concept:** Natural selection as the "Classic" example.
*   **The Lesson:** It's not about "trying" (Lamarck); it's about "dying" (Darwin). The environment selects the tall ones by killing the short ones.
*   **Time Scale:** Millions of years.

### 2. The Fast Pattern: The Virus
*   **The Concept:** Non-living (or borderline) entities follow the same rules.
*   **The Lesson:** Speed makes the pattern visible. While we debate, the virus iterates billions of times.
*   **Time Scale:** Weeks or months.

### 3. The Synthesis
*   **The Insight:** The Pattern is everywhere. Whether it's a neck growing or a spike protein mutating, the engine is the same: Iteration + Selection = Optimization.
