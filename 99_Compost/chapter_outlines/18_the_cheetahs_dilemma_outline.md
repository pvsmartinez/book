# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Refactored for Soul & Flow
**Goal:** Explain the "Unwanted Consequences" of optimization. Explain how compounding a single metric (Speed, Profit, Efficiency) creates "Blind Spots" that eventually lead to fragility.

### 1. The Cheetah: A Masterpiece of Trade-offs
*   **The Story:** The perfect running machine.
*   **The Catch:** It optimized for the "Sprint" but forgot the "Fight."
*   **The Lesson:** Efficiency is a trade-off.

### 2. The Traffic Paradox
*   **The Example:** Optimization of individual travel $\to$ Collective gridlock.
*   **Mechanism:** When the "Solution" scales, it becomes the "Problem."

### 3. The Paradox of Fragility
*   **Concept:** The more you fit a specific environment, the more vulnerable you are to any change.
*   **The Designer's View:** We need to optimize for *Resilience*, not just *Speed*.
