# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Draft (Session 7)
**Goal:** Explain how initial advantages (buffers) compound over time to create massive inequality, regardless of merit.

---

### 1. The Power of the Buffer (Financial Compounding)
*   **Concept:** "Being in front" is a structural advantage.
*   **Example:** Ana (with a seed) vs. Bruno (starting at zero).
*   **Context:** The Selic rate and generational wealth.
*   **Lesson:** The gap grows because of the system's math, not just individual effort.

### 2. The Relative Age Effect (Opportunity Compounding)
*   **Concept:** Compounding applies to opportunity, not just money.
*   **Example:** Professional Hockey/Soccer players born in Q1.
*   **Mechanism:** Small maturity gap $\rightarrow$ Selection $\rightarrow$ Better Coaching $\rightarrow$ Massive Skill Gap.

### 3. The Perfect Imbalance
*   **Concept:** Systems are rarely perfectly balanced; they often have a slight bias.
*   **Example:** White pieces in Chess (First Mover Advantage).
*   **Lesson:** In games, we swap sides to balance this. In life, we rarely do.

### 4. The Takeaway
*   **Closing Thought:** The "Judge" selects the fittest *right now*, but that selection gives the winner the resources to be even fitter *tomorrow*. The error compounds.
