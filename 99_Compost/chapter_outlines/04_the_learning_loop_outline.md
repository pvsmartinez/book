# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Draft
**Goal:** Explain "Internal Iteration" (Learning) and how we can intentionally design the speed of the engine.

---

### 1. The Internal Engine
*   **The Concept:** Learning is just selection happening inside your brain.
*   **The Mechanic:** Trial and error. You try a thought/action, the environment gives feedback, you keep the "good" ones.

### 2. Designing the Speed
*   **Education:** Why teachers use homework and projects to create smaller iteration cycles than just the final exam.
*   **Video Games:** The gold standard of high-speed iteration.
*   **The Non-Learnable:** Why some things (like stock picking) are hard to learn due to noisy or delayed feedback.

### 3. The Lesson
*   **The Insight:** Iteration speed is a design choice. We can control how fast we learn by changing the environment.
