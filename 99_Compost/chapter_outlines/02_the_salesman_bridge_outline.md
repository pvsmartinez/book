# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Draft
**Goal:** Introduce the concept of "Selection" using a relatable, human example before diving into the math.

### 1. The Observation
*   **The Archetype:** Picture a "Salesman." What do you see?
    *   Charming.
    *   Good with words.
    *   Persuasive.
    *   Maybe a bit aggressive?
*   **The Question:** Why do they all look like that?
    *   Is there a secret "University of Sales" that teaches everyone to be exactly the same?
    *   Is it a conspiracy?

### 2. The Mechanism (The "Why")
*   **The Environment:** To survive as a salesman, you must close deals. If you don't sell, you don't eat (or you get fired).
*   **The Filter:** The customer.
    *   Customers buy from people they trust, like, or are persuaded by.
    *   Customers *don't* buy from people who are rude, shy, or confusing.
*   **The Process:**
    *   Thousands of people try to be salespeople.
    *   The "rude" ones fail and leave the job.
    *   The "shy" ones fail and leave the job.
    *   The "charming" ones succeed, stay, and teach the next generation.

### 3. The Evolution
*   **Individual Level:** A single salesperson tries a pitch. It fails. They try a different pitch (Variance). It works (Feedback). They repeat the working pitch (Iteration).
*   **Group Level:** Over decades, the *profession itself* evolves. The "Salesman Personality" is not a choice; it is the **survivor** of a ruthless selection process.

### 4. The Takeaway
*   It’s not that "Salesmen are evil."
*   It’s that the **Environment** selected for **Charm**.
*   This same logic applies to everything.
