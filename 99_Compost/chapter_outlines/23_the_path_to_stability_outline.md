# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Draft (Session 11)
**Goal:** Explain structural lock-in using the "Local Maximum" concept. Systems tend toward stable configurations (like molecules or QWERTY) even if they are not the best possible configurations.

---

### 1. Survival of the Stable
*   **Concept:** Chaos $\rightarrow$ Stability.
*   **Analogy:** Molecules in a box. Unstable ones break; stable ones persist. The universe calcifies not by design, but by the "persistence of the stable."
*   **Lesson:** Systems naturally find a state of rest (Stable Configuration).

### 2. The Local Maximum (The Hill)
*   **Concept:** Optimization leads to the top of the *nearest* hill, not the highest mountain.
*   **The Trap:** To get to the higher peak, you have to go down (lose efficiency/stability).
*   **Graph:** Visualizing the "Valley of Death" between the Local Max and the Global Max.

### 3. The Role of Luck (The Cheetah)
*   **Story:** Why did the Cheetah evolve to run and not to hide?
*   **Mechanism:** Randomness + Hill Climbing. A small random variation started the path up the "Speed Hill," and once started, the system optimized that specific trait. It could have gone the other way (Stealth), but it didn't.

### 4. Infrastructure Lock-In (QWERTY)
*   **Real World:** We are stuck on "Local Maxima" everywhere.
*   **Example:** QWERTY keyboards. Designed to be slow. We keep them because "switching costs" (going down the hill) are too high.
*   **Conclusion:** Stability *is* the trap.
