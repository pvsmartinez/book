# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Edited
**Goal:** Show that the pattern ($Adaptation = \frac{Filter(Iteration \times Variance)}{Time}$) is scale-invariant. It applies to atoms, cells, companies, and nations.

### Flow:
1.  **The Fractal:** We've seen it in Biology (Cells) and Minds (Memes). Now we zoom out.
2.  **The Corporate Organism:** Companies are just slow biological entities. The market is the filter.
3.  **The Nation State:** *Why Nations Fail*. Institutions are the "Rules of the Game" that determine iteration speed.
4.  **The Synthesis:** From the gene (*The Selfish Gene*) to the meme (Chapter 7) to the nation (*Why Nations Fail*). It is all the same code.
