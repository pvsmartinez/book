# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Refactored (Session 10)
**Goal:** Explain how systems and their Value Functions evolve over time, often drifting away from their original purpose toward "Stable Configurations" that may be detrimental.

---

### 1. From Gas to Planets
*   **Concept:** Systems tend toward stability.
*   **Analogy:** The early universe (Chaos) -> Gravity -> Stars/Planets (Structure).
*   **Lesson:** Optimization + Time = Structure. The system "calcifies" into a shape.

### 2. The Drift of the Goal
*   **Concept:** We don't just optimize for the goal; the optimization *changes* the goal.
*   **Mechanism:** Goodhart's Law on steroids. We start measuring a proxy, and eventually, the proxy becomes the reality.

### 3. Case Study: The Venture Capital Drift
*   **Phase 1 (Innovation):** High risk, high reward.
*   **Phase 2 (Growth):** Land grab.
*   **Phase 3 (Financialization):** Optimizing for the *next round*, not the customer.
*   **Lesson:** The system is still "working," but the Value Function has drifted.

### 4. The Stability Trap
*   **Concept:** Once a system drifts into a stable configuration, it resists change.
*   **Closing Thought:** The "Judge" isn't static. It evolves with us.
