# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Draft
**Goal:** Explain "Competitive Iteration" where two players react to each other.

---

### 1. The Red Queen Effect
*   **The Concept:** "Running to stay in place."
*   **The Shift:** In the last chapter, the tree was static. In this chapter, the "tree" is another player who is also running.

### 2. Examples of Rivalry
*   **Nature:** Cheetah vs. Gazelle. (Speed vs. Speed).
*   **Agriculture:** The Pesticide Treadmill. (Poison vs. Resistance).
*   **Society:** Cops vs. Robbers / Hackers vs. Security. (Locks vs. Lockpicks).

### 3. The Lesson
*   **The Insight:** Iteration doesn't happen in a vacuum. Every move you make changes the environment for your rival, forcing them to iterate, which in turn changes the environment for you. It's a feedback loop of action and reaction.
