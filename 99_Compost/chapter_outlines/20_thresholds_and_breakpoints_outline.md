# Chapter Outline & Blocking

**Status:** Refactored (Session 6)
**Goal:** Introduce the concept of non-linear systemic shifts, where linear changes in a variable lead to sudden, disruptive changes in the outcome.

### 1. The RPG Analogy
*   **Concept:** Breakpoints in game design.
*   **Example:** 10 damage vs. 30 HP (3 hits) -> 13 damage (still 3 hits) -> 16 damage (2 hits).
*   **Lesson:** Not all 1% increases are the same. Some cross a threshold that changes the fundamental math of the encounter. A 1% increase in damage can lead to a 33% increase in efficiency.

### 2. The Invisible Cliff
*   **Concept:** Systems that look stable until they hit a breaking point.
*   **Focus:** Why systems feel like they "suddenly" break.
*   **Context:** Tying back to the energy company from Chapter 19.

### 3. The Takeaway
*   **Closing Thought:** The world isn't linear. It's a series of plateaus and cliffs.
